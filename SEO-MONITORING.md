# 📊 SEO Monitoring Integration

This folder is linked to your automated SEO monitoring system for The Profit Platform.

## 🔗 Symlink Location

```
/mnt/c/Users/abhis/projects/atpp/tpp/seo-monitoring
    ↓ (symlink)
/mnt/c/Users/abhis/projects/tpp
```

The `seo-monitoring` folder in this directory is a **symbolic link** to the main SEO monitoring system. This allows you to access it from your Astro project folder while keeping the actual system files in a separate location.

## 🎨 Astro Site Compatibility

### ✅ What Works (Same as WordPress)
- ✅ Keyword ranking tracking
- ✅ Competitor analysis
- ✅ Discord notifications
- ✅ Daily reports
- ✅ 90-day history
- ✅ Position change alerts

### ❌ What Doesn't Work (Static Site Limitation)
- ❌ Bulk H1 tag fixes (no WordPress API)
- ❌ Auto content updates (static files)
- ❌ Individual page analysis via API

**Solution:** System provides **recommendations** for fixes, you apply them manually to your Astro `.md` or `.astro` files.

2. Install dependencies
3. Set up 3 cron jobs (9 AM, 5 PM, Sunday)
4. Test Discord notification
5. Start automated monitoring

**VPS Location:** Same VPS as your blog automation (tpp-vps)

- ✅ `.env` file is gitignored

**WordPress credentials:** Set to "n/a" since this is an Astro static site.

After 30 days, compare:

HTML reports in `seo-monitoring/logs/` show:
- Competitor analysis
- Top-ranking pages
- Ranking opportunities
- Historical trends

Review these weekly to refine your content strategy.

### 4. Location Targeting
All keywords are tracked with **Sydney, New South Wales, Australia** location for accurate local SEO results.

### 5. Keyword Research Source
Keywords were auto-selected from:
`/mnt/c/Users/abhis/projects/atpp/tpp/archive/docs/KEYWORD_RESEARCH.md`

Full research includes 40+ keywords - these 10 are the highest priority.

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

```bash
