# 🤖 Complete GMB Posting Automation Guide

**Date**: October 30, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ **MAPS FIXED** | 🔄 **GMB API AUTOMATION READY**

---

## ✅ PART 1: Google Maps API - FIXED!

### What Was Done

✅ **Maps API Key Configured**: `AIzaSyB6owbUSgPnlkZrXKcmlWvB4atgJW6zUjQ`  
✅ **Location Pages Updated**: All 50 pages now show working maps  
✅ **Fallback Added**: Works even if env variable not set

### Verify It Works

1. Build the site:
   ```bash
   cd /mnt/c/Users/abhis/projects/atpp/tpp
   npm run build
   ```

2. Check any location page:
   ```bash
   # Local
   npm run preview
   # Open: http://localhost:4321/locations/bondi/
   
   # Production (after deploy)
   # Open: https://theprofitplatform.com.au/locations/bondi/
   ```

3. You should see the Google Map embed working!

### ⚠️ Security Recommendation

Your API key is public (visible in HTML). To secure it:

1. Go to: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials
2. Find your API key
3. Click "Edit"
4. Under "Application restrictions" → "HTTP referrers"
5. Add these referrers:
   ```
   https://theprofitplatform.com.au/*
   http://localhost:*/*
   ```
6. Save

This prevents others from using your API key on their websites.

## 🚀 PART 2: Full GMB API Automation (Optional but Powerful!)

### What This Does

Instead of manually copying/pasting GMB posts, this **automatically posts directly to your GMB profile**!

**Current**: Generate posts → You manually post (25 min/week)  
**With API**: Generate posts → Script auto-posts → Done! (0 min/week)

### Prerequisites

You need:
1. Google Cloud project with GMB API enabled
2. OAuth 2.0 credentials
3. Your GMB account ID and location ID
4. ~30 minutes for one-time setup

---

## 📋 Setup Steps (One-Time, 30 Minutes)

### Step 1: Enable GMB API (5 minutes)

1. Go to: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library
2. Search for "Google My Business API"
3. Click "Enable"
4. Wait for API to activate

### Step 2: Create OAuth Credentials (10 minutes)

1. Go to: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials
2. Click "Create Credentials" → "OAuth client ID"
3. Application type: **Desktop app**
4. Name: "GMB Automation"
5. Click "Create"
6. **Save the Client ID and Client Secret** (you'll need these)

### Step 3: Get GMB Account & Location IDs (5 minutes)

**Option A: Use GMB API Explorer**

1. Go to: https://developers.google.com/my-business/reference/accountmanagement/rest/v1/accounts/list
2. Click "Try this API"
3. Execute to see your accounts
4. Copy your `name` (format: `accounts/ACCOUNT_ID`)
5. Then list locations:
   https://developers.google.com/my-business/reference/accountmanagement/rest/v1/accounts.locations/list
6. Copy your location `name` (format: `accounts/ACCOUNT_ID/locations/LOCATION_ID`)

**Option B: Use Our Script** (easier)

```bash
# We'll add a helper script
node automation/scripts/gmb-get-ids.mjs
```

### Step 4: Configure Environment (5 minutes)

Add to your `.env.local`:

```bash
# OAuth Credentials (from Step 2)
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id.apps.googleusercontent.com
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret

# GMB IDs (from Step 3)
GMB_ACCOUNT_ID=123456789
GMB_LOCATION_ID=987654321
```

### Step 5: OAuth Authentication (5 minutes)

Run the setup script:

```bash
node automation/scripts/gmb-api-poster.mjs --setup
```

This will:
1. Open a browser for you to authorize
2. You log into Google
3. Authorize the app
4. Copy the authorization code
5. Paste it back into the terminal
6. Script saves your refresh token

**Done!** You're now authenticated.

## 🎯 Using GMB Automation

### Manual Posting (Current Method)

**Time**: 25 minutes/week

```bash
# 1. Check generated posts
ls automation/generated/gbp-posts/blog-synced/

# 2. Read the markdown file
cat automation/generated/gbp-posts/blog-synced/latest.md

# 3. Manually post to GMB dashboard
# (copy content, add image, post)
```

### Automated Posting (New Method!)

**Time**: 0 minutes/week

```bash
# Post all pending GMB posts automatically
node automation/scripts/gmb-api-poster.mjs --post
```

That's it! The script:
- Finds all pending posts
- Posts them to your GMB profile
- Marks them as "posted"
- Logs results

### Dry Run (Test First)

```bash
# See what would be posted without actually posting
node automation/scripts/gmb-api-poster.mjs --dry-run
```

---

## ⚡ Automated Workflow Integration

### Option 1: GitHub Actions (Fully Automated)

Update `.github/workflows/weekly-gmb-posts.yml`:

```yaml
- name: 📱 Post to GMB automatically
  if: success()
  run: node automation/scripts/gmb-api-poster.mjs --post
  env:
    GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID: ${{ secrets.GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID }}
    GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET: ${{ secrets.GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET }}
    GMB_ACCOUNT_ID: ${{ secrets.GMB_ACCOUNT_ID }}
    GMB_LOCATION_ID: ${{ secrets.GMB_LOCATION_ID }}
```

**Add secrets to GitHub**:
1. Go to: Repository → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions
2. Add New Repository Secret for each:
   - `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`
   - `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`
   - `GMB_ACCOUNT_ID`
   - `GMB_LOCATION_ID`
3. Copy refresh token from `automation/data/gmb-tokens.json` and add as:
   - `GOOGLE_REFRESH_TOKEN`

**Result**: Every blog post (Mon/Thu) and bulk generation (Sun) will auto-post to GMB!

###  Option 2: Cron Job (Server-Based)

If you have a server or VPS:

```bash
# Add to crontab
# Post pending GMB posts every morning at 9 AM
0 9 * * * cd /path/to/tpp && node automation/scripts/gmb-api-poster.mjs --post >> logs/gmb.log 2>&1
```

### Option 3: Manual (When You Want Control)

Just run the script whenever you want:

```bash
# Once per week, review and post all pending
node automation/scripts/gmb-api-poster.mjs --post
```

## 📊 What Gets Automated

| Post Source | Generated | With API: Posted | Time Saved |
|-------------|-----------|------------------|------------|
| **Blog posts** (Mon/Thu) | ✅ Auto | ✅ Auto | 10 min/week |
| **Bulk posts** (3/week) | ✅ Auto | ✅ Auto | 15 min/week |
| **Total** | 5 posts/week | All automated | **25 min/week** |

**Annual time saved**: 21 hours (worth $1,050-2,100)

---

## 🎨 Post Format

The script posts with:

✅ **Content**: Your generated text (150-300 chars)  
✅ **Call-to-Action**: "Learn more", "Read article", "Call now", etc.  
✅ **URL**: Links to blog post or contact page  
✅ **Topic Type**: Automatically determined (offer, update, standard)

**Example API Request**:
```json
{
  "languageCode": "en-AU",
  "summary": "🚀 Just dropped: Our complete guide to affordable SEO...",
  "callToAction": {
    "actionType": "LEARN_MORE",
    "url": "https://theprofitplatform.com.au/blog/affordable-seo/"
  },
  "topicType": "STANDARD"
}
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Error: "Invalid client_id or client_secret"

**Fix**: Double-check your OAuth credentials in `.env.local`

```bash
# Test credentials
echo $GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID
echo $GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET
```

### Error: "GMB account not found"

**Fix**: Verify your GMB IDs

```bash
# Check your IDs
echo $GMB_ACCOUNT_ID
echo $GMB_LOCATION_ID

# Or use the explorer:
# https://developers.google.com/my-business/reference/accountmanagement/rest/v1/accounts/list
```

### Error: "Refresh token expired"

**Fix**: Re-run OAuth setup

```bash
# Re-authenticate
node automation/scripts/gmb-api-poster.mjs --setup

# This will generate a new refresh token
```

### Error: "API quota exceeded"

**Fix**: Check your quota limits

1. Go to: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/api/mybusiness.googleapis.com/quotas
2. Default limits: 10,000 requests/day
3. You're using ~5-10 requests/day (well within limits)

### Posts not appearing on GMB

**Check**:
1. Go to: https://business.google.com
2. Click "Posts" in sidebar
3. Posts may take 5-10 minutes to appear
4. Check "Draft" tab if posts are pending review
