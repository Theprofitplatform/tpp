- **Analytics:** Verify tracking implementation

---

## 👥 TEAM RESPONSIBILITIES

### Primary Developer

## 🔒 ROLLBACK PLAN

If any critical functionality breaks during rescue:

```bash
# Emergency rollback to backup point
git reset --hard rescue-backup-20251015

# Or restore working core manually
cp -r working-core/* ./
npm install
npm run build
npm run deploy
```

**Note:** Backup point `rescue-backup-20251015` captures pre-rescue state.
