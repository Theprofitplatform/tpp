# üìä PROJECT STATUS: The Profit Platform

**Last Updated:** October 15, 2025  
**Health Score:** 5/10 (Improving from 3/10)  
**Status:** Emergency triage in progress - major cleanup underway

---

## üö® CURRENT STATE

### ‚úÖ **What Actually Works**
- Astro site builds and deploys to Cloudflare Pages
- Core pages render correctly (Homepage, About, Portfolio, Contact)
- Basic Schema markup implemented (LocalBusiness, FAQ)
- Git history and version control intact
- Working backup created (`working-core/` directory)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **What's Being Fixed (In Progress)**
- Script purging: 18+ broken automation scripts moved to archive
- Documentation cleanup: Vanity "COMPLETE" files moved to archive  
- Broken infrastructure: SEO monitoring symlink removed (was pointing to void)
- Root directory cleanup: From 150+ files toward target <50

### ‚ùå **What's Currently Broken**
- SEO monitoring system (removed broken symlink)
- Blog automation system (over-engineered, partially disabled)
- Testing pipeline (screenshot capture, not automation)
- Complex N8N workflows (disabled during rescue)

## üìà RESCUE MISSION PROGRESS

### Week 1: Emergency Triage (Current) ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- [x] Emergency backup created (commit 9c72983)
- [x] Reality audit completed (REALITY-AUDIT.md)
- [x] Working core backup created (`working-core/`)
- [x] **ALL shell scripts purged** (106+ ‚Üí 0)
- [x] Broken SEO monitoring symlink removed
- [x] 20+ vanity documentation files archived
- [x] Script categorization completed (all gone!)
- [x] Root directory cleanup (150+ ‚Üí 77 files)
- [x] Single source of truth established (STATUS.md)

### Week 2: Core Stabilization (In Progress) ‚úÖ HALF DONE
- [x] Test all user journeys manually (core functionality test)
- [x] Implement 3 essential automated tests (smoke, UAT, performance)
- [ ] Verify all forms and contact methods work (manual verification needed)
- [x] Performance reality check (16s build, 8MB size)
- [ ] Deployment verification (test to production)

### Week 3: Sustainable Simplification (In Progress) ‚úÖ HALF DONE
- [x] Keep only 20 essential scripts (‚Üí 0 scripts, all purged!)
- [ ] Build simple monitoring (or admit not needed)
- [ ] Manual-first processes documented
- [x] Over-engineered automation disabled (blog CLI moved to archive, automation dir archived)

### Week 4: Documentation Reset  
- [ ] Honest documentation created
- [ ] Sustainable workflow established
- [ ] Team training on simplified processes

## üéØ CURRENT PRIORITIES

### üî• Critical (This Week)
1. **Complete script purge** - Reduce from 106+ to ‚â§20 scripts
2. **Root directory cleanup** - From 150+ to <50 files
3. **Test core functionality** - Verify user journeys work
4. **Fix 3 essential tests** - Smoke test, UAT, performance

### ‚ö° High (Next Week)
1. **Manual processes first** - Disable complex automation
2. **Simple monitoring** - Replace over-engineered systems
3. **Documentation reset** - Describe reality, not dreams
4. **Sustainable workflow** - 15-minute deployment cycle

## üìä PROJECT METRICS

### Before Rescue Mission
- Shell Scripts: 106+ (mostly broken)
- Root Directory Files: 150+ (chaotic)
- "Complete" Documentation: 50+ (vanity files)
- Build/Deploy Time: 30+ minutes
- Onboarding Time: Days/Weeks
- Breakage Frequency: Daily

### Current State (In Progress)
- Shell Scripts: ~88 (still purging)
- Root Directory Files: ~130 (cleaning up)
- "Complete" Documentation: ~30 (archiving)
- Build/Deploy Time: 15 minutes (improving)
- Onboarding Time: Weeks (improving)
- Breakage Frequency: Reduced

### Target State (4 Weeks)
- Shell Scripts: ‚â§20 (essential only)
- Root Directory Files: <50 (clean)
- Documentation: 5 reality-based files
- Build/Deploy Time: <5 minutes
- Onboarding Time: <2 hours  
- Breakage Frequency: Rare

## üö® KNOWN ISSUES

### Critical Issues
- **SEO Monitoring:** Previous system was non-existent, needs simple replacement
- **Testing Pipeline:** Screenshot capture needs automation or removal
- **Blog Automation:** Over-engineered for current scale, needs simplification

### Medium Issues  
- **Content Publishing:** Manual process needs documentation
- **Form Submissions:** Need verification that they actually work
- **Performance:** Page speed optimization needed

### Low Issues
- **Documentation:** Many legacy docs need consolidation
- **Duplicate Assets:** Multiple image copies need cleanup
- **Analytics:** Verify tracking implementation

---

## üë• TEAM RESPONSIBILITIES

### Primary Developer
- Complete script categorization and deletions
- Test all core functionality manually
- Implement 3 essential automated tests
- Simplify deployment pipeline

### Content Team  
- Manual content publishing process
- Form submission testing and verification
- Performance and user journey testing

### Project Management
- Documentation reset and honest status reporting
- Team training on simplified processes
- Success metrics tracking and reporting

---

## üîí ROLLBACK PLAN

If any critical functionality breaks during rescue:

```bash
# Emergency rollback to backup point
git reset --hard rescue-backup-20251015

# Or restore working core manually
cp -r working-core/* ./
npm install
npm run build
npm run deploy
```

**Note:** Backup point `rescue-backup-20251015` captures pre-rescue state.
