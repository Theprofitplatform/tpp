## 🎓 Key Learnings

### Test Suite Optimization
1. **Redundancy is common during debugging** - Iterative debugging creates many similar tests
2. **Consolidation requires analysis** - Must understand what each test does before archiving
3. **Documentation is critical** - Future developers need to understand consolidation decisions
4. **Structure matters** - Organized directories make maintenance easier

### Production Verification
1. **Automated parity checking saves time** - Manual comparison is error-prone
2. **CSS load order matters** - Cloudflare optimizations can change order
3. **SEO tags must match** - Production should mirror local build
4. **Visual verification needed** - Tools can't catch everything

### Project Health
1. **Incremental improvements compound** - 5/10 → 7/10 → 8/10
2. **Technical debt hurts velocity** - 52 tests → 10 tests = faster development
3. **Documentation enables team** - Clear docs = easier onboarding
4. **Automation reduces errors** - Parity scanner catches issues early
