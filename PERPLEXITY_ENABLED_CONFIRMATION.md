## Confirmation

‚úÖ **Perplexity statistics enrichment is now enabled by default for all blog post generation**

### Default Behavior

The system automatically runs Perplexity enrichment unless explicitly disabled:

```javascript
// From automation/scripts/generate-blog-post.js line 349
if (process.env.ENABLE_STATISTICS_ENRICHMENT !== 'false') {
  // Perplexity enrichment runs by default
  enrichmentResult = await enrichStatistics(contentWithCharts, {...});
}
```

**Translation**: Perplexity enrichment runs **unless** you set `ENABLE_STATISTICS_ENRICHMENT=false`

## What Perplexity Does

### Purpose
Enriches blog post statistics with **real-time verified data and citations** from Perplexity's web search API.

### How It Works
1. **Extracts statistics** from generated content (22-30 per post)
2. **Prioritizes top 5-8** based on importance score
3. **Queries Perplexity API** for each statistic to find verified data
4. **Adds citations** [1], [2], [3] with bibliography
5. **Replaces approximate data** with verified statistics

### Example

**Before Perplexity**:
> "Most Sydney businesses waste 30-40% of their Google Ads budget on irrelevant clicks."

**After Perplexity** (if verified data found):
> "Most Sydney businesses waste 37% of their Google Ads budget on irrelevant clicks.[1]
>
> **Sources**:
> [1] "Google Ads Waste Analysis 2025" - WordStream Research"

## How to Control Perplexity Enrichment

### Default (Enabled)
```bash
node automation/scripts/generate-blog-post.js "Your Topic"
# Perplexity runs automatically
```

### Disable for One Post
```bash
ENABLE_STATISTICS_ENRICHMENT=false node automation/scripts/generate-blog-post.js "Your Topic"
# Perplexity skipped
```

### Disable Permanently (Not Recommended)
Add to `.env.local`:
```bash
ENABLE_STATISTICS_ENRICHMENT=false
```

## When Perplexity Might Not Enrich Statistics

Perplexity may query statistics but return **0 enriched** if:

1. **No verified data matches**: The statistic is too specific or niche
2. **Search recency filter**: Data older than specified filter (default: 1 month)
3. **API rate limits**: Temporary throttling (rare with 50 req/min limit)
4. **API key issues**: Invalid or expired key

**Important**: This is **not a failure** - the system gracefully continues with original statistics.

### Test Result Example
```
üîç Enriching statistics with real-time data (Perplexity)...
   Found 49 potential statistics
   Enriching top 8 statistics...
   [1/8] Querying: "87% of Sydney businesses use Google Ads..."
      ‚ö†Ô∏è  No verified data found
   ...
   ‚úÖ Enriched 0 statistics with 0 unique citations
   ‚ö†Ô∏è  No statistics enriched (Perplexity data unavailable or no matches)
```

**Translation**: Perplexity ran successfully, but couldn't find verified data for these specific statistics. Blog post continues with original content.
