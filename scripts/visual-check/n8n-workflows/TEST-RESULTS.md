# n8n Visual Agent - Test Results

## ‚úÖ PROGRESS SO FAR

### Issues Fixed:

1. **‚úÖ Workflow Ownership** - Added shared_workflow entry
   - Workflow now has proper owner/project association

2. **‚úÖ Directory Permissions** - Fixed for root user
   - `/home/avi/projects/astro-site/scripts/visual-check/test-results/`
   - `/home/avi/projects/astro-site/scripts/visual-check/screenshots/`
   - `/home/avi/projects/astro-site/scripts/visual-check/logs/`

3. **‚úÖ Playwright Browsers** - Installed for root user
   - Chromium 140.0.7339.186 installed
   - Chromium Headless Shell installed
   - Browsers located in `/root/.cache/ms-playwright/`

4. **‚úÖ Workflow Error Handling** - Updated to continue on test failures
   - `continueOnFail: true` added to test execution node
   - Tests now run even when some fail

### Current Status:

**Playwright Tests**: ‚úÖ RUNNING SUCCESSFULLY
- Tests execute and complete (60 second duration)
- Results are generated
- Test artifacts created in `test-results/artifacts/`
- Latest run stats: 21 passed, 15 failed (typical for current site issues)

**Workflow Execution**: ‚ö†Ô∏è FAILING ON LATER NODE
- Execution ID 771: Status "error" after 59.59 seconds
- Tests are running but workflow fails on subsequent node
- Need to identify which node after tests is failing

### Test Runs:

| Execution | Status | Duration | Notes |
|-----------|--------|----------|-------|
| 766 | error | 0.03s | Missing ownership |
| 767 | error | 16.2s | Permission denied |
| 768 | error | 15.8s | Permission denied |
| 770 | error | 61.1s | Playwright browsers missing |
| 771 | error | 59.6s | Tests run, later node fails |

### Next Steps:

1. ‚úÖ Identify which node is failing after Playwright tests
2. Fix the failing node configuration
3. Verify complete workflow execution
4. Test email notification delivery
5. Verify screenshot capture
6. Confirm summary.json update

## üîç Investigation Needed:

The workflow flow is:
```
Webhook Trigger
  ‚Üì
Run Playwright Tests (‚úÖ WORKING)
  ‚Üì
Check Test Success (?)
  ‚Üì
Read Test Results JSON (?)
  ‚Üì
Parse Test Results (?)
  ‚Üì
...additional nodes...
```

Need to determine which node after "Run Playwright Tests" is causing the failure.
