MALFORMED RESOURCE PATHS DETECTED
==================================================

The following resources have incorrect URLs that need fixing:

Replace "https://js/component-loader.js" with "/js/component-loader.js" in HTML
Replace "https://js/emergency-fixes-loader.js" with "/js/emergency-fixes-loader.js" in HTML

These paths are being resolved incorrectly by the browser.
Update your HTML templates to use correct relative or absolute paths.

Example: Change <script src="/js/file.js"> NOT <script src="https://js/file.js">
