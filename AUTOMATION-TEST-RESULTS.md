## Known Limitations & Future Enhancements

### Current Limitations
1. **No Internal Linking** - Generated posts don't include internal links yet
   - Could be enhanced with `build-internal-link-map.mjs` data
2. **No Images** - Posts don't include featured images
   - Could integrate Unsplash API in future
3. **Optional Services** - Plagiarism check and notifications are placeholders
   - Can be enabled by configuring API keys

### Recommended Enhancements
1. Add internal linking suggestions using link map
2. Integrate Unsplash for featured images
3. Add FAQ schema generation (detected but not implemented)
4. Configure Slack/Email notifications for production use
