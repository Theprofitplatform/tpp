### 5. Keyword Integration Strategies

#### Natural Keyword Placement
```markdown
✅ GOOD (Natural):
"For Sydney businesses looking to improve their SEO, local keyword
targeting is essential. By optimizing for location-specific terms
like 'digital marketing Sydney,' you can attract more qualified leads."

❌ BAD (Stuffed):
"SEO Sydney services SEO Sydney agency. Our Sydney SEO experts provide
Sydney SEO optimization for Sydney businesses. Contact our Sydney SEO
company for Sydney SEO services."

Primary Keyword Placement:
✅ Title tag (at beginning)
✅ H1 heading
✅ First paragraph (first 100 words)

✅ Image ALT text
✅ Naturally throughout content

Secondary Keywords:

Example for 2000-word article:
- Primary keyword: 20-40 times (1-2%)
- Secondary keywords: 10-20 times each (0.5-1%)
- LSI keywords: Throughout naturally
