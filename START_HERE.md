## 💡 Key Success Principles

1. **Start with tracking** - Don't skip Phase 0 (you'll regret it)
2. **Be patient** - Local SEO takes 3-6 months to show results
3. **Be consistent** - 30 min/week tracking > binge then quit
4. **Follow the data** - Tracking tells you what's working
5. **Quality > quantity** - 5 great pages > 20 mediocre pages

---

## 🚨 Common Mistakes to Avoid

- ❌ Skipping tracking setup (can't prove ROI later)
- ❌ Inconsistent NAP across citations (Google penalty)
- ❌ Building 100 citations in 1 week (spam penalty)
- ❌ Thin location pages (Google ignores them)
- ❌ Fake reviews or incentives (ethics + penalty risk)
- ❌ Giving up after 1 month (SEO needs 3-6 months)

✅ **Follow the guides = avoid these mistakes**

---
