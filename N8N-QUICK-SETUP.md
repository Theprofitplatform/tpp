## ðŸŽ‰ You're Done!

Your automation is now **100% set up and working!**

## ðŸ”— Connect to GitHub Actions (Optional - 5 minutes)

**Make it fully automatic every Sunday:**

```bash
# 1. Go to GitHub repo: https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/tpp

# 2. Settings â†’ Secrets and variables â†’ Actions

# 3. Click "New repository secret"

# 4. Fill in:
#    Name: N8N_WEBHOOK_URL
#    Value: http://your-vps-ip:5678/webhook/gmb-posts

# 5. Click "Add secret"
```

**That's it!** Now every Sunday:
- GitHub generates 12 posts
- Sends them to n8n automatically
- n8n posts them to GMB on schedule
- **You do nothing!**

---

## ðŸ“‹ Send Your Real Posts

```bash
# Send your 12 existing posts to n8n:
npm run automation:gmb-send-n8n automation/generated/gbp-posts/gbp-posts-2025-10-21.json

# n8n will schedule and post them automatically!
```

---

## ðŸ†˜ Troubleshooting

### **"Can't access n8n"**
```bash
# Check if n8n is running:
curl http://your-vps-ip:5678/healthz

# If not, start it:
docker start n8n
# or
npm start  # (depending on how you installed it)
```

### **"Google authentication failed"**
```bash
# In n8n:
# 1. Click "Create GMB Post" node
# 2. Click your credential
# 3. Click "Reconnect"
# 4. Login again
```

### **"Webhook not working"**
```bash
# Test webhook directly:
curl -X POST http://your-vps-ip:5678/webhook/gmb-posts \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '[{"content":"test"}]'

# Should get response:
# {"status":"success","message":"Received 1 posts"}
```

â””â”€ GitHub Actions generates 12 posts
â””â”€ Sends to n8n webhook
â””â”€ n8n receives them

n8n then:
â””â”€ Schedules each post
â””â”€ Waits for the scheduled time
â””â”€ Posts to GMB automatically
â””â”€ Logs the result

You do: NOTHING! ðŸŽŠ
