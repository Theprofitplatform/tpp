# üöÄ Quick Railway Deployment Guide

## Current Status
‚úÖ Frontend deployed to Cloudflare Pages
‚úÖ Backend tested locally (working perfectly!)
‚è≥ Backend needs Railway deployment (requires browser auth)

## Deploy Backend in 5 Minutes

### Step 1: Railway Login & Deploy

Open your terminal and run:

```bash
cd /mnt/c/Users/abhis/projects/atpp/tpp/backend-server

# Login (opens browser)
railway login

# Create new project
railway init
# When prompted:
# - Project name: tpp-backend
# - Environment: production

# Deploy
railway up

# Get your deployment URL
railway domain
```

**Copy the URL** - it will look like: `https://tpp-backend-production.up.railway.app`

### Step 2: Configure Cloudflare Pages

```bash
cd ..

# Set environment variable
npx wrangler pages project env add BACKEND_API_URL production
# When prompted, paste your Railway URL (from Step 1)

# Verify it was set
npx wrangler pages project env list
```

### Step 3: Redeploy Frontend

```bash
npm run deploy
```

### Step 4: Test Production

Visit: https://theprofitplatform.com.au/tools/keyword-gap

Test with:
- Your site: `theprofitplatform.com.au`
- Competitor: `searchenginepeople.com.au`

Expected: 11 keyword gaps, 4 easy wins, $6,252/month value

## Alternative: Railway Dashboard (No CLI)

1. Go to https://railway.app/new
2. Click "Empty Project"
3. Click "Deploy from GitHub repo" OR "Deploy from local directory"
4. If local: Select `/backend-server` folder
5. Railway auto-detects Node.js and runs `npm start`
6. Click on your deployment ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Generate Domain
7. Copy the domain URL
8. Add to Cloudflare (see Step 2 above)

## Troubleshooting

**Railway deployment failed?**
- Check logs in Railway dashboard
- Verify `package.json` and `server.js` exist
- Ensure Node.js 18+ selected

**Cloudflare env var not working?**
- Verify variable name is exactly: `BACKEND_API_URL`
- Must include `https://`
- No trailing slash
- Redeploy frontend after adding

**Tool shows "Backend not configured"?**
- Check Cloudflare env var is set: `npx wrangler pages project env list`
- Verify Railway deployment is running
- First request may take 10-20s (cold start)

## Cost Summary

- Railway: $5 free credit/month, then ~$2-5/month
- Total: $2-5/month (or free for first month)

## Success Metrics

‚úÖ Backend responds to `/health`
‚úÖ API returns keyword gap analysis
‚úÖ Frontend displays results
‚úÖ Email capture working
‚úÖ Tool generates leads!
