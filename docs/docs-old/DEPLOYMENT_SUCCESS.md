## 📊 SUCCESS METRICS

### Week 1 Goals:
- [ ] Deployment complete
- [ ] GSC set up & sitemap submitted
- [ ] GMB claimed & optimized
- [ ] 4-8 citations submitted
- [ ] Tracking verified working

### Week 2-4 Expectations:
- 📈 50-100 organic visitors/day

### Month 2 Expectations:

---

## 🐛 TROUBLESHOOTING

### If pages return 404 after deploy:
**Cause:** Cloudflare cache
**Fix:** Wait 5-10 minutes, then clear Cloudflare cache

### If tracking doesn't work:
**Check:**
1. View source → GA4 code present?
2. Browser console → any errors?
3. Test in incognito (bypasses cache)
4. Use GA Debugger Chrome extension

### If sitemap doesn't show:
**Check:**
1. Visit /sitemap-index.xml directly
2. If 404, rebuild: `npm run build && npm run deploy`
3. Resubmit to GSC
