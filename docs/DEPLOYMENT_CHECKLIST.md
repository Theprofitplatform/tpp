# We Rebuilt Our Competitor Analysis Tool (And Made It Actually Honest)

Most "free SEO tools" promise the world and deliver guesses.

We decided to do the opposite.

Our new SEO Quick Compare tool is the ONLY free competitor
analysis that's transparent about what's real vs. estimated.

**What's Real:**
- Performance scores from Google
- On-page metrics (word count, images, meta tags)
- Core Web Vitals

**What's Estimated (and we tell you):**
- Domain Authority (±30%)
- Traffic estimates
- Backlink approximations

Check it out: [link]

Read our full methodology: [link]

Because honesty builds trust better than fake promises.
```

### Social Media

**LinkedIn Post:**
```
🔍 Transparency in action.

We rebuilt our free SEO tool to be the ONLY one that's
honest about what's real vs. estimated.

✅ Real Google PageSpeed data
✅ Clearly labeled estimates
✅ Full methodology disclosure

Because trust matters more than marketing hype.

Try it: [link]

**Twitter/X:**
```
We rebuilt our free SEO comparison tool with one rule:

Complete honesty.

✅ Real PageSpeed data from Google
✅ Clear labels on all estimates
✅ Full methodology available

Because fake promises destroy trust.

## FAQ - Common Issues

### "PageSpeed data not showing"

**Check:**
1. Is API key set in Cloudflare environment variables?
2. Check Functions logs for "PageSpeed fetch failed"
3. Verify API key is valid in Google Cloud Console
4. Check API quota (25k/day limit)

**Temporary fix:**
- Tool works fine with estimates
- Users see note: "Estimate only - enable PageSpeed API for real data"

### "Analysis takes too long"

**Normal behavior:**
- PageSpeed API: 20-30 seconds (industry standard)
- HTML scraping: 2-5 seconds
- Total: 25-35 seconds

**User perception:**
- Progressive loading shows progress
- Messages set expectations
- Feels thorough, not broken

### "PDF export not working"

**Possible causes:**
1. Browser blocking popup (ad blocker)
2. jsPDF CDN down (use fallback message)
3. Very old browser (IE11)

**Fallback:**
- "Print Report" always works
- Browser native print to PDF

### "Estimates seem off"

**Expected:**
- ±30% variance is normal
- Clearly labeled as estimates
- Methodology page explains formulas

**Response:**
- "These are educational approximations. For verified data, we recommend a professional audit."
