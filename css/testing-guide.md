## Common Issues and Solutions

### Navigation Issues
1. **Menu toggle not working**
   - Check JavaScript loading
   - Verify CSS classes match JS selectors

2. **Navigation not responsive**
   - Check media query syntax
   - Verify container max-width settings

3. **Dropdown not appearing**
   - Check z-index stacking
   - Verify hover selectors

### Performance Issues
1. **Layout shift on load**
   - Add size attributes to images
   - Reserve space for dynamic content

2. **Slow animations**
   - Use transform instead of layout properties
   - Enable hardware acceleration with translateZ(0)

## Success Criteria

Implementation is considered successful when:
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Performance metrics meet targets
- [ ] No accessibility violations
- [ ] Cross-browser compatibility confirmed
- [ ] Mobile experience is smooth
- [ ] No layout shifts or rendering issues

## Rollback Plan

If issues are discovered:
1. Comment out new CSS files in index.html
2. Remove mobile-nav.js script tag
3. Test that original functionality is restored
4. Address issues and re-deploy

## Maintenance Notes

### Regular Checks
- Monitor Core Web Vitals monthly
- Update browser compatibility as needed
- Review accessibility compliance quarterly
- Performance audit every 6 months

### Future Improvements
- Implement CSS custom properties for theming
- Add dark mode support
- Consider CSS containment for better performance
- Evaluate CSS Grid for layout improvements
