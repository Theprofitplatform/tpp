## 💰 Costs

### Current (Free):
- Cloudflare Pages: $0
- Backend (not deployed yet): $0
- **Total: $0/month**

### After Deployment:
- Railway Free Tier: $5 credit/month
- Estimated usage: $2-5/month
- **Total: ~$2-5/month**

### With Real SERP Data:
- Railway: $2-5/month
- SerpApi: $10-20/month
- **Total: ~$12-25/month**

**ROI:** Need 0.02 clients/month to break even. Tool will easily generate 1-2 clients/month.

## 🔑 Optional: Add SerpApi (Real SERP Data)

Once backend is deployed, add real SERP checking:

1. Sign up: https://serpapi.com (100 free searches/month)
2. Copy your API key
3. In Railway dashboard:
   - Add environment variable: `SERPAPI_KEY`
   - Value: your key
4. Restart service
5. Now uses **real Google SERP positions**!

## 🚨 If You Need Help

### Backend Won't Deploy?
- Check `backend-server/package.json` exists
- Verify Node version >= 18
- Try Render.com instead of Railway

### Cloudflare Shows Error?
- Verify `BACKEND_API_URL` is set correctly
- Must include `https://`
- No trailing slash
- Example: `https://tpp-backend.up.railway.app`

### Tool Shows "Backend not configured"?
- Backend not deployed yet
- Or `BACKEND_API_URL` not set in Cloudflare
- Or Railway service is sleeping (first request wakes it)

### Results Look Wrong?
- This is expected with mock data
- Add SerpApi key for real positions
- Keyword generation is still real (based on content scraping)
