# Case Study: How We Got a Parramatta Plumber 2.6x More Calls in 30 Days

**Client:** Local plumbing business (name withheld for privacy)
**Location:** Parramatta, NSW
**Timeline:** 30 days (September 2024)
**Result:** 2.6x increase in phone calls (62 ‚Üí 163 calls/month)

---

## The Challenge

In August 2024, a Parramatta plumbing company reached out to us with a problem that many Sydney tradies face:

**"We're getting some calls from Google, but nowhere near enough. We know there's more business out there, but our competitors seem to be getting it instead."**

### Starting Situation:
- ‚ùå Receiving 62 calls per month from online sources
- ‚ùå Ranking #8-12 for "plumber Parramatta" (page 2)
- ‚ùå Zero rankings for emergency keywords
- ‚ùå Google My Business listing was incomplete
- ‚ùå Website was slow (7.2 second load time)
- ‚ùå Running Google Ads inefficiently ($2,800/month, poor ROI)
- ‚ùå Only 12 Google reviews (4.2 stars)

### Their Goals:
‚úÖ Double phone calls within 90 days
‚úÖ Rank on page 1 for primary keywords
‚úÖ Improve Google Ads ROI
‚úÖ Build sustainable lead generation system

**Budget:** $3,500/month (split between Google Ads and SEO)

---

## The Strategy

We implemented a hybrid approach focusing on **quick wins** (Google Ads + GMB optimization) and **long-term growth** (SEO + content).

### Month 1 Focus: Low-Hanging Fruit

Our philosophy: **Get results fast, then build for the long-term.**

Here's what we did in the first 30 days:

---

## Part 1: Google My Business Optimization (Week 1)

**Time Investment:** 4 hours
**Cost:** $0 (included in service)
**Impact:** Immediate visibility increase

### What We Fixed:

#### Before:
```
Business Name: "Mike's Plumbing"
Description: "We do plumbing in Parramatta"
Photos: 3 (low quality)
Reviews: 12 reviews (4.2 stars)
Posts: None
Services: Not listed
Hours: Incorrect
```

#### After:
```
Business Name: "Mike's Plumbing Parramatta"
Description: "24/7 Emergency Plumber in Parramatta &
Surrounding Suburbs. Blocked Drains, Hot Water, Gas
Fitting, Burst Pipes. Licensed & Insured. Call Now!"
Photos: 35+ (before/after, team, van, jobs)
Reviews: 27 reviews (4.7 stars) - see review strategy below
Posts: 3 weekly posts (tips, offers, updates)
Services: 15+ services listed with descriptions
Hours: Correct + 24/7 emergency available
```

### GMB Optimization Checklist We Used:

‚úÖ **Category Optimization**
- Primary: Plumber
- Secondary: Emergency plumber service, Drain cleaning service, Gas engineer

‚úÖ **Keyword-Rich Description**
- Included "Parramatta" 3 times
- Listed all services
- Added "24/7 emergency" (high-intent keyword)
- Mentioned surrounding suburbs

‚úÖ **Photo Strategy**
- Uploaded 35 photos across categories:
  - 10 before/after job photos
  - 5 team photos (builds trust)
  - 5 vehicle/branding photos
  - 10 individual service photos (drain cleaning, hot water, etc.)
  - 5 customer interaction photos

‚úÖ **Weekly Google Posts**
Week 1: "Emergency Plumbing Tips: What to Do Before We Arrive"
Week 2: "$50 Off Hot Water Repairs This Month"
Week 3: "Meet the Team: Our Licensed Parramatta Plumbers"

‚úÖ **Q&A Section**
- Added 15 common questions with keyword-rich answers
- Example: "Do you service Westmead?" ‚Üí "Yes, we provide 24/7 emergency plumbing in Westmead, Harris Park, Granville, and all Parramatta suburbs."

**Result after 1 week:**
üìà GMB views increased 340%
üìà Direction requests increased 180%
üìà Phone calls from GMB increased 65%

---

## Part 2: Google Ads Overhaul (Week 1-2)

**Previous Setup (Wasteful):**
- Budget: $2,800/month
- Clicks: 180/month
- CPC: $15.56 average
- Calls: 35/month
- Cost per call: $80

**Our Analysis:**
‚ùå Broad match keywords wasting budget on irrelevant searches
‚ùå No negative keywords (paying for "DIY plumbing", "plumbing courses", etc.)
‚ùå Ads showing 24/7 across all of Sydney (too broad)
‚ùå Landing page had 7.2 second load time
‚ùå No call tracking to know which keywords convert

### What We Changed:

#### 1. Restructured Keyword Strategy

**Before:** 5 ad groups, 50+ keywords (messy)

**After:** 12 tightly themed ad groups

**High-Intent Emergency Keywords** (Top Priority, Higher Bids)
```
[emergency plumber parramatta] - Exact match
[burst pipe parramatta] - Exact match
[blocked drain parramatta] - Exact match
"24 hour plumber parramatta" - Phrase match
```

**Service-Specific Keywords** (Medium Priority)
```
[hot water repair parramatta] - Exact match
[gas plumber parramatta] - Exact match
"drain cleaning parramatta" - Phrase match
```

**Surrounding Suburbs** (Lower Bids, Volume Play)
```
plumber westmead
plumber harris park
plumber granville
plumber merrylands
```

#### 2. Added 127 Negative Keywords

Excluded searches like:
- "DIY plumbing"
- "plumbing course"
- "plumber salary"
- "plumbing tools"
- "free plumbing advice"
- "plumbing jobs"

**Impact:** Reduced wasted clicks by 40%

#### 3. Geo-Targeting Optimization

**Before:** All of Sydney (way too broad)

**After:**
- Primary: Parramatta + 5km radius
- Secondary: Westmead, Harris Park, Granville, Merrylands, Wentworthville (10km radius)
- Excluded: Areas 20km+ away (too far to service)

**Impact:** CPC dropped from $15.56 to $11.20 (closer targeting = less competition)

#### 4. Ad Copy Overhaul

**Before (Generic):**
```
Plumber Parramatta | Call Us Today
Professional plumbing services. Licensed and insured.
Call now for a free quote.
```

**After (High-Converting):**
```
Emergency Plumber Parramatta | 24/7
Burst Pipes ¬∑ Blocked Drains ¬∑ Hot Water ¬∑ Gas Fitting
$0 Callout ¬∑ Fixed Price Quotes ¬∑ Same Day Service
‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê 27 Google Reviews ¬∑ Call Now: (02) XXXX XXXX
```

**Key improvements:**
- Included "24/7" and "Emergency" (high-intent)
- Listed specific services
- Added "$0 Callout" (removes objection)
- Showed 5-star reviews (social proof)
- Phone number in ad (click-to-call on mobile)

#### 5. Landing Page Speed Optimization

**Before:** 7.2 second load time (terrible!)

**After:** 1.4 second load time

**How we did it:**
- Compressed images (WebP format)
- Removed unnecessary scripts
- Implemented CDN (Cloudflare)
- Minified CSS/JS
- Lazy loading for below-the-fold images

**Impact:** Conversion rate increased from 8% to 14.5%

#### 6. Implemented Call Tracking

**Added:** CallRail dynamic number insertion

**Why it matters:** Now we know exactly which keywords drive calls (not just clicks)

**Discovery:** "Emergency plumber Parramatta" converted at 22% (great!) while "plumber near me" converted at only 4% (cut budget for this).

### Google Ads Results (After 30 Days):

**New Performance:**
- Budget: $2,800/month (same)
- Clicks: 250/month (‚Üë39%)
- CPC: $11.20 average (‚Üì28%)
- Calls: 98/month (‚Üë180% üöÄ)
- Cost per call: $28.57 (‚Üì64% üöÄ)

**ROI Calculation:**
- Average job value: $450
- Close rate: 60%
- 98 calls √ó 60% = 59 jobs
- 59 jobs √ó $450 = $26,550 revenue
- Ad spend: $2,800
- **ROI: 9.5:1** (vs. previous 2.8:1)

---

## Part 3: Review Generation System (Week 2-4)

**Problem:** Only 12 reviews (4.2 stars) ‚Äî not enough social proof

**Goal:** Get to 25+ reviews with 4.5+ stars

### Our Review System:

#### Step 1: Identify Happy Customers
- After every job, technician asks: "Are you happy with the service?"
- If yes ‚Üí trigger review request

#### Step 2: SMS Follow-Up (2 hours after job)

- **Impact:** Conversion rate increased (people trust businesses with 25+ reviews and 4.5+ stars)

---

## Why This Worked: The Key Insights

### 1. We Focused on Quick Wins First
Most agencies want to do 6-month SEO plans. We got results in Week 1 with GMB optimization.

### 2. We Fixed the Leaks Before Adding Traffic
No point driving traffic to a slow website with a bad phone number. We optimized conversion FIRST.

### 3. We Used Data to Guide Decisions
Call tracking revealed which keywords actually generated calls (not just clicks). We doubled down on winners, cut losers.

### 4. We Built Social Proof Aggressively
27 reviews > 12 reviews = massive trust increase = higher conversion rate.

### 5. We Hyper-Localized Everything
"Parramatta" in GMB name, ad copy, content, meta tags. Google rewards local relevance.

---

## What Happened Next (Months 2-6)

We didn't stop at 30 days. Here's how it continued:

**Month 2:**
- Calls: 163 ‚Üí 195 (+20%)
- Organic traffic starting to compound
- Rankings improving

**Month 3:**
- Calls: 195 ‚Üí 230 (+18%)
- Ranked #3 for "plumber Parramatta"
- Reduced Google Ads budget to $2,200 (SEO picking up slack)

**Month 6:**
- Calls: 230 ‚Üí 285 (+24%)
- Ranked #2 for "plumber Parramatta"
- Ranked #1 for "emergency plumber Parramatta"
- Google Ads budget reduced to $1,500
- **Total calls from free organic: 140/month**

**Current Status (Month 12):**
- Calls: 320+/month
- Google Ads: $800/month (brand protection only)
- SEO drives 70% of leads
- Business revenue increased 400%+ since we started
- Hired 2 additional plumbers to handle demand

---

## Can This Be Replicated?

**Yes, but with caveats.**

This worked because:
‚úÖ They had a real business with good service (we can't fix bad service)
‚úÖ They responded quickly to calls (speed matters)
‚úÖ They committed to the review process (asked every customer)
‚úÖ Parramatta is a high-demand market (works in most suburbs)
‚úÖ They trusted our process and didn't micromanage

This might NOT work as well if:
‚ùå Your business has fundamental service issues
‚ùå You're in a tiny market (e.g., population <10K)
‚ùå You don't have budget for Google Ads + SEO
‚ùå You want "overnight success" (this took 30 days of work)
