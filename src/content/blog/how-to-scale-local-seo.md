## The Challenge of Multi-Location SEO

You've dominated search in your home city. Now you're expanding to new locations. But how do you replicate that success at scale?

Most businesses make the mistake of duplicating their homepage for each location. Google sees this as thin content and it rarely ranks well.

Here's the proven framework we use to help clients dominate local search across dozens of cities.

## Step 1: Create Unique Location Pages

Each location needs a dedicated page with **unique, valuable content**:

- Service area descriptions (not just addresses)
- Local landmarks and neighborhoods served
- Location-specific case studies and testimonials
- City-specific FAQs
- Embedded Google Maps
- Local business schema markup

### Example Structure

```
/locations/sydney/
/locations/melbourne/
/locations/brisbane/
```

## Step 2: Optimize Google Business Profiles

For each location, create and optimize:

- Complete business information
- Regular posts (at least weekly)
- Customer photos and videos
- Q&A section
- Service area definitions
- Local phone numbers

## Step 3: Build Location-Specific Content

Create content that targets local search intent:

- "[Service] in [City]" blog posts
- Local industry news and trends
- Community involvement stories
- Local event sponsorships

## Step 4: Earn Local Citations and Links

For each location, build:

- Local directory listings (Yelp, Yellow Pages, etc.)
- Chamber of Commerce memberships
- Local news mentions
- Sponsorships and partnerships
- Local resource page links

## Step 5: Track Performance by Location

Monitor each location separately:

- Google Business Profile insights
- Local keyword rankings
- City-specific traffic and conversions
- Phone calls and direction requests

## The Results

Using this framework, our clients typically see:

- **50-100% increase** in local search visibility within 3-6 months
- **First page rankings** for "service + city" keywords
- **30-50% more qualified leads** from local search
- **Lower cost per acquisition** compared to paid ads

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ Duplicating content across location pages
❌ Using P.O. boxes instead of real addresses
❌ Neglecting Google Business Profile optimization
❌ Building links only to the homepage
❌ Not tracking location-specific metrics
