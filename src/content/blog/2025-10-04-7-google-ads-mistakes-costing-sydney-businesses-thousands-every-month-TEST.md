## The Cost of Google Ads Mistakes

If you're running Google Ads for your Sydney business, even small mistakes can cost you thousands of dollars every month. After managing hundreds of campaigns, we've identified the 7 most common and expensive errors.

## 1. Not Using Negative Keywords

Without negative keywords, your ads appear for irrelevant searches, wasting your budget on clicks that never convert.

## 2. Ignoring Quality Score

Low quality scores mean you pay more per click than competitors. Most Sydney businesses don't even know what their quality score is.

## 3. Poor Landing Page Experience

Sending all traffic to your homepage instead of dedicated landing pages kills conversion rates.

## 4. Not Tracking Conversions Properly

If you can't measure ROI accurately, you can't optimize effectively. Many businesses are flying blind.

## 5. Using Broad Match Too Liberally

Broad match keywords can drain budgets quickly if not managed carefully with proper negative keywords.

## 6. Setting and Forgetting

Google Ads requires constant monitoring and optimization. Set-and-forget campaigns waste money.

## 7. Bidding on Branded Terms Only

While branded terms are important, you're missing out on new customer acquisition if that's all you bid on.
