## Frequently Asked Questions

### How long does SEO take to work in Brisbane?
**3-6 months for significant results.** Quick wins (long-tail keywords) can rank in 4-8 weeks. Brisbane is less competitive than Sydney, so results often come faster. SEO compounds over time.

### Do you guarantee first-page rankings?
**No one can guarantee rankings** (Google's algorithm changes constantly). However, we follow proven strategies that consistently get results. We focus on ROI (leads, revenue) rather than just rankings.

### What's the difference between SEO and Google Ads?
**SEO = long-term, "free" traffic.** Takes months but lasts for years.
**Google Ads = immediate paid traffic.** Instant results but costs ongoing.

### Do you work with businesses outside Brisbane?
**Yes!** We serve all of South East Queensland including Gold Coast, Sunshine Coast, and regional areas, plus businesses across Australia.

### Can I do SEO myself?
**Yes, but it's time-consuming.** If you have 10-15 hours per week and are willing to learn, our [free SEO checklist](/seo-checklist) will guide you. Most businesses find it more cost-effective to hire experts.

### What industries do you NOT work with?
We don't work with: adult content, gambling, get-rich-quick schemes, or anything unethical. Otherwise, we're open to all industries.

### How does Brisbane's market compare to Sydney/Melbourne?
**Less competitive, more opportunities.** Brisbane has fewer established SEO competitors, making it easier and cheaper to rank. Great time to establish market leadership before competition increases.

### Do you specialize in Brisbane tourism businesses?
**Yes!** Tourism and hospitality are key Brisbane strengths. We have extensive experience with hotels, tours, restaurants, and experiences targeting both domestic and international visitors.
