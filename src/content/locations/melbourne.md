## Frequently Asked Questions

### How long does SEO take to work in Melbourne?
**3-6 months for significant results.** Quick wins (long-tail keywords) can rank in 4-8 weeks. Competitive keywords in Melbourne CBD take 5-8 months. SEO is a long-term investment that compounds over time.

### Do you guarantee first-page rankings?
**No one can guarantee rankings** (Google's algorithm changes constantly). However, we follow proven strategies that consistently get results. We focus on ROI (leads, revenue) rather than just rankings.

### What's the difference between SEO and Google Ads?
**SEO = long-term, "free" traffic.** Takes months but lasts for years.
**Google Ads = immediate paid traffic.** Instant results but costs ongoing.

### Do you work with businesses outside Melbourne?
**Yes!** While we specialize in Melbourne, we help businesses across VIC, Australia, and internationally.

### Can I do SEO myself?
**Yes, but it's time-consuming.** If you have 10-15 hours per week and are willing to learn, our [free SEO checklist](/seo-checklist) will guide you. Most businesses find it more cost-effective to hire experts.

### What industries do you NOT work with?
We don't work with: adult content, gambling, get-rich-quick schemes, or anything unethical. Otherwise, we're open to all industries.

### How much should I spend on Google Ads in Melbourne?
**Depends on your industry and goals.** Most Melbourne service businesses start with $2,500-$5,000/month in ad spend. Competitive industries in Melbourne CBD may need $8,000-$15,000/month.

### Do I need a new website?
**Not always.** If your current website is modern, fast, and mobile-friendly, we can optimize it. If it's outdated, slow, or non-responsive, a new website will significantly improve results.
