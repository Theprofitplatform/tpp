## ⚡ QUICK START (5 Minutes)

### Step 1: Run Setup Script
```bash
# Navigate to project
cd /mnt/c/Users/abhis/projects/atpp/tpp

# Run setup (creates backup, installs deps, creates directories)
./scripts/setup-improvements.sh
```

The script will:
- ✅ Create feature branch & backup
- ✅ Install new dependencies
- ✅ Create directory structure
- ✅ Check environment variables
- ✅ Generate implementation checklist

### Step 2: Review Files Created

You now have 3 key files:

1. **PARALLEL-IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md** → Complete 5-day plan
2. **IMPLEMENTATION-CHECKLIST.md** → Track your progress
3. **automation/lib/** → Foundation files ready

### Step 3: Choose Your Approach

**Option A: Solo Developer (Recommended)**
- Follow day-by-day plan sequentially
- Complete all Day 1 tasks before Day 2
- 5 days total (6 hours/day)

**Option B: Team of 3-4**
- Assign streams to developers:
  - Dev 1: Stream 1 + Stream 6
  - Dev 2: Stream 2 + Stream 5
  - Dev 3: Stream 3
  - Dev 4: Stream 4
- Work in parallel
- 3-4 days total

**Option C: Quick Wins Only**
- Just fix critical issues (Day 1 only)
- Skip nice-to-haves
- 1 day total

### Setup Script Fails
```bash
# Check Node version
node --version  # Should be v18+

# Check npm
npm --version

# Manually install deps
npm install nodemailer vitest @vitest/ui flesch-kincaid
```

# Reinstall deps
rm -rf node_modules
npm install

# Check env vars
cat .env.local
```

### API Errors
```bash
# Validate environment
node automation/lib/env-validator.mjs

# Check API key format
echo $ANTHROPIC_API_KEY | grep "sk-ant-"

# Test API connection
node automation/scripts/test-perplexity.mjs
```

### Git Issues
```bash
# Reset to backup
git reset --hard HEAD~1

## 💡 PRO TIPS

### Speed Up Development
1. **Use aliases**:
   ```bash
   alias test-auto='npm run test:watch'
   alias check-health='npm run health'
   ```

2. **Use multiple terminals**:
   - Terminal 1: Code editor
   - Terminal 2: Test watcher
   - Terminal 3: Log viewer
   - Terminal 4: Manual testing

3. **Commit frequently**:
   - After each task completion
   - Before risky changes
   - At end of each day

### Avoid Common Mistakes
❌ **Don't**:
- Skip testing
- Work on multiple streams at once (solo)
- Forget to commit
- Ignore errors in logs
- Deploy without staging tests

✅ **Do**:
- Test as you go
- Follow the order
- Read error messages
- Check logs frequently
- Use dry-run mode
