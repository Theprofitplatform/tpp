## ‚úÖ **Step 3: Add to .env.local**

Once you have both IDs, add them to your `.env.local` file:

```bash
# GMB Account & Location IDs
GMB_ACCOUNT_ID=123456789012345678
GMB_LOCATION_ID=987654321098765432
```

**Example:**
```bash
# GMB Account & Location IDs
GMB_ACCOUNT_ID=105924398574920193847
GMB_LOCATION_ID=285472049375820193847
```

## ‚úÖ **Step 4: Test the Setup**

After adding the IDs, test it:

```bash
# Dry run (won't actually post)
export GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID="YOUR_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID"
export GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET="YOUR_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET"
node automation/scripts/gmb-api-poster.mjs --dry-run
```

If you see:
```
üì± GMB Automated Posting
üß™ DRY RUN MODE - No actual posts will be made
üìÑ Found X pending post(s)
```

**You're ready!** Now run the real posting:

```bash
node automation/scripts/gmb-api-poster.mjs --post
```

## üéØ **Quick Test Business Profile**

Not sure which business? Here's how to verify:

1. Go to: https://business.google.com
2. You should see "The Profit Platform" or your business name
3. Click on it
4. That's the one we'll be posting to!

## üêõ **Troubleshooting**

### Can't find Account ID?

Try this API call:
```
https://mybusinessaccountmanagement.googleapis.com/v1/accounts
```

Use OAuth Playground:
1. Go to: https://developers.google.com/oauthplayground/
2. Select "Google My Business API v4"
3. Click "Authorize APIs"
4. Exchange authorization code
5. Make the API call to `/accounts`

### Can't find Location ID?

Check all your locations:
```
https://mybusinessbusinessinformation.googleapis.com/v1/accounts/YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID/locations
```

## üí° **Pro Tip: Get IDs via cURL**

If you're comfortable with command line:

```bash
# Get access token
curl -X POST https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token \
  -d "client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID" \
  -d "client_secret=YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET" \
  -d "refresh_token=$(cat automation/data/gmb-tokens.json | grep refresh_token | cut -d'"' -f4)" \
  -d "grant_type=refresh_token"

# Use that token to list accounts
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
  https://mybusinessaccountmanagement.googleapis.com/v1/accounts

# List locations
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
  https://mybusinessbusinessinformation.googleapis.com/v1/accounts/YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID/locations
```
