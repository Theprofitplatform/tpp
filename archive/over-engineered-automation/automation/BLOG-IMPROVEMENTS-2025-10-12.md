# Blog Content Improvements - October 12, 2025

## ✅ Phase 1 Implementation Complete

### Overview
Implemented critical E-E-A-T (Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trustworthiness) improvements to blog automation system to enhance Google ranking potential and reduce AI content detection risk.

---

## 🎯 Changes Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Prompt Template ✅

**File:** `automation/prompt-templates/blog-post.txt`

**Key Changes:**
- ✅ Increased word count requirement: 1800-2200 → **2500-3500 words**
- ✅ Added **explicit ban on fabricated statistics**
- ✅ Added **explicit ban on AI clichés** ("game-changer", "shocking", "secrets", etc.)
- ✅ **Required unique TPP framework** for each post
- ✅ Mandated real data sources with citations
- ✅ Emphasized genuine experience over fabrication

**Banned Content:**
```
❌ Fabricated statistics (e.g., "76% of Sydney businesses...")
❌ Made-up case studies (e.g., "A Bondi Junction café...")
❌ Invented revenue numbers (e.g., "$500K+ revenue")
❌ AI clichés ("game-changer", "shocking", "secrets")
```

**Required Content:**
```
✅ Industry data with citations
✅ General observations ("We've noticed...")
✅ Unique TPP frameworks (e.g., "TPP Local SEO Pyramid")
✅ Real methodology descriptions
✅ Honest limitations
```

---

### 2. Chart Generation Limits ✅

**File:** `automation/scripts/chart-generator.js`

**Change:** Already limited to **2 charts maximum** per post (line 186)

**Impact:**
- Reduces obvious automation patterns
- Previous posts had 10-17 charts (AI red flag)
- Now maximum 2 per post (appears more human)

---

### 3. Author Bio System ✅

**File:** `automation/scripts/generate-blog-post.js`

**New Function:** `addAuthorBio(content, authorName)`

**What It Does:**
- Loads author data from `src/data/authors.json`
- Appends author bio section to every blog post
- Shows credentials, role, expertise
- Adds LinkedIn link (when available)

**Bio Format:**
```markdown
---

## About the Author

**[Author Name]** is a [Role] at The Profit Platform. [Bio text]

**Areas of Expertise:** [Expertise 1], [Expertise 2], [Expertise 3]

[Connect on LinkedIn](url)
```

**Benefits:**
- Strengthens E-E-A-T signals
- Demonstrates real expertise
- Builds individual author authority
- Shows human authorship

---

### 4. Statistics Verification ✅

**File:** `automation/scripts/generate-blog-post.js`

**Status:** Already enabled by default

**System:**
- Uses Perplexity API to enrich statistics with real data
- Replaces generic claims with verified statistics
- Adds proper citations
- Falls back gracefully if data unavailable

**Configuration:** `ENABLE_STATISTICS_ENRICHMENT !== 'false'` (enabled)
