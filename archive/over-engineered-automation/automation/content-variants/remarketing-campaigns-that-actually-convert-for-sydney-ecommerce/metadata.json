      "body": "Hey [First Name],\n\nHope you're having a productive week. I was reviewing some data this morning that stopped me in my tracks, and I knew I had to share it with fellow Sydney business owners.\n\nHere's something that might make you pause next time you check your analytics: 87% of Sydney online stores never follow up with visitors who didn't buy. That's not just a missed opportunity - it's like watching thousands of dollars walk out the door every single month.\n\nLet me share three quick insights that could change your approach:\n\nFirst, consider this staggering number - 96% of visitors leave online stores without purchasing. They're interested enough to browse, but something stops them from completing the transaction. The good news? These are your warmest leads, not cold traffic.\n\nSecond, we've seen Sydney stores achieve remarkable turnarounds. One inner-city fashion retailer went from 3% to 25% conversion rates just by implementing proper remarketing. That's not an outlier either - we consistently see 15-25% improvements with strategic follow-up campaigns.\n\nThird, timing matters more than you might think. About 40% of conversions happen after the initial visit. When you reach people at the right moment with the right message, you're not being pushy - you're being helpful.\n\nI've put together a complete guide showing exactly how to set up remarketing campaigns that actually convert for Sydney eCommerce. It walks through the specific strategies that work for our local market and the common pitfalls to avoid.\n\nWould you like to see the full breakdown? You can read it here: [Insert Link]\n\nCheers,\nTPP Team\n\nP.S. I included some real examples of Sydney businesses that transformed their results using these exact strategies - including one that doubled their revenue in 90 days without increasing their ad spend.",
