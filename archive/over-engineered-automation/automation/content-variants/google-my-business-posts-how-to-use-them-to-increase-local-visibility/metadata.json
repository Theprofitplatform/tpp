      "body": "Hey [First Name],\n\nI just finished analyzing 200+ Sydney businesses from Parramatta to Bondi, and I'm honestly shocked by what I found. Nearly 9 out of 10 local businesses are throwing money at Google Ads while completely ignoring a free feature that could double their visibility.\n\nWe're talking about Google My Business posts - and the numbers don't lie.\n\n**Here's what blew my mind:**\n\nThe businesses that DO use GMB posts consistently get 67% more customer actions on their profiles. That's more calls, more website clicks, more direction requests - all the stuff that actually puts money in your pocket.\n\nYet 89% of Sydney businesses have never posted once.\n\n**The four types of posts that actually work:**\n\nWhat Posts - Perfect for showcasing your latest products or services. Think of them as mini advertisements that appear right in your Google listing.\n\nEvent Posts - Great for promoting sales, workshops, or special events. These get a natural urgency boost since they're time-sensitive.\n\nOffer Posts - These are your conversion goldmines. Special deals, discounts, or promotions that give people a reason to choose you right now.\n\nNews Posts - Use these for company updates, new locations, or industry insights. They keep your profile fresh and show you're actively running your business.\n\n**The posting strategy that's working:**\n\nI've seen the best results when businesses rotate between post types and keep a consistent schedule. Even posting once a week makes a massive difference to how Google perceives your business activity.\n\nThe key is treating these posts like mini marketing campaigns, not afterthoughts. Each post should have a clear purpose and a reason for someone to take action.\n\n**Why this matters more in Sydney:**\n\nWith our competitive market - especially in areas like the CBD, North Shore, and Eastern Suburbs - every advantage counts. When someone searches for your type of business, these posts can be the difference between them choosing you or your competitor down the street.\n\nI've put together everything I learned from this analysis, including the exact posting templates that are working best for Sydney businesses right now.\n\nYou can check out the full breakdown here: [link to full blog post]\n\nIt's got the specific strategies, timing recommendations, and real examples from local businesses that are crushing it with GMB posts.\n\nCheers,\nAvi\n\nP.S. If you haven't claimed your Google My Business profile yet, that's step one. But if you have claimed it and you're not posting regularly, you're leaving serious money on the table. The businesses in my study that started posting consistently saw results within the first month.",
