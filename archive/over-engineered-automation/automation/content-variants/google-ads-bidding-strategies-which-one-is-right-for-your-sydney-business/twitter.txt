❌ MISTAKE #1: Using "automated bidding" from day one

Google's AI needs data to work. Without conversion history, it's flying blind.

Result: You're paying premium prices for random clicks.

🎯 SMART BIDDING vs MANUAL: When to use each

Manual bidding: New accounts, testing keywords, tight budgets

Smart bidding: 30+ conversions/month, established accounts, scaling up

Most Sydney businesses jump to smart bidding too early.

💡 PRO TIP: Start with "Enhanced CPC" 

It's the sweet spot between manual control and automation.

Google adjusts your bids slightly based on conversion likelihood, but you stay in control.

Perfect for most local Sydney businesses.

• High click costs, low conversions
• Lots of traffic from irrelevant searches  
• Budget burning through by noon
• Clicks from outside your service area
