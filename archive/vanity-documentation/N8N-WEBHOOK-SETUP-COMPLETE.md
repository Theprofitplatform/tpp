# ‚úÖ n8n Webhook Setup Complete - Final Steps

## üéØ What's Been Done

I've created and deployed everything needed for n8n webhook automation:

### ‚úÖ Created:
1. **3 Webhook Workflows** (deployed to n8n)
2. **Automated test script** (`test-n8n-webhook.sh`)
3. **Complete n8n + Claude integration** (scripts, agents, slash commands)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è The Issue:
n8n API has a limitation - **webhook workflows must be manually activated in the UI** for webhooks to register. This is by design for security.

---

## üöÄ Quick Setup (2 minutes)

### Step 1: Activate the Minimal Test Webhook

1. **Open**: https://n8n.theprofitplatform.com.au/workflow/XXLvBVPAUGWt35oD
2. **Click**: The toggle switch in the top-right (should turn blue/green)
3. **Verify**: It says "Active"

###Step 2: Test It

Run this command:

```bash
bash test-n8n-webhook.sh
```

Or manually:

```bash
curl -X POST https://n8n.theprofitplatform.com.au/webhook/minimal-test \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"test":"hello from Claude!"}'
```

**Expected Response**: JSON with your request data echoed back

---

## üìä Available Webhooks

### 1. **Minimal Test** ‚≠ê (Recommended for first test)
- **ID**: `XXLvBVPAUGWt35oD`
- **URL**: `/webhook/minimal-test`
- **What it does**: Simply echoes back your request data
- **Activate**: https://n8n.theprofitplatform.com.au/workflow/XXLvBVPAUGWt35oD

### 2. **Blog Automation Test**
- **ID**: `54xYxJPXqDOV40L3`
- **URL**: `/webhook/blog-test`
- **What it does**:
  - Processes webhook data with JavaScript
  - Sends Discord notification
  - Returns result
- **Activate**: https://n8n.theprofitplatform.com.au/workflow/54xYxJPXqDOV40L3

### 3. **Full Blog Automation** (Needs API endpoint)
- **ID**: `ocIhahMuBNMy1hNs`
- **URL**: `/webhook/blog-automation-trigger`
- **What it does**:
  - Calls your blog automation API at `http://127.0.0.1:4321/api/automation/blog-automation`
  - Sends Discord notifications
  - Returns result
- **Activate**: https://n8n.theprofitplatform.com.au/workflow/ocIhahMuBNMy1hNs
- **Note**: Requires blog automation API endpoint (see below)

---

## üß™ Testing Commands

### Test Minimal Webhook (after activating)

```bash
curl -X POST https://n8n.theprofitplatform.com.au/webhook/minimal-test \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message":"Hello from command line!"}'
```

### Test Blog Automation (after activating)

```bash
curl -X POST https://n8n.theprofitplatform.com.au/webhook/blog-test \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"test":true,"message":"Testing blog automation!"}'
```

**Expected**: Discord notification + JSON response

### Automated Test Script

```bash
./test-n8n-webhook.sh
```

This script:
- Checks if workflow is active
- Tests the webhook
- Shows detailed response
- Provides troubleshooting info

---

## üìù Next Steps

### Option A: Just Test the Webhook System

1. Activate **Minimal Test** webhook (Step 1 above)
2. Run `bash test-n8n-webhook.sh`
3. ‚úÖ Done! Webhooks are working!

### Option B: Build Full Blog Automation

You need to create the API endpoint that the webhook calls:

**File**: `backend/api/automation/blog-automation.js` (or similar)

**Expected Endpoint**: `POST /api/automation/blog-automation`

**Expected Request Body**:
```json
{
  "force": false,
  "enableGitCommit": true,
  "enableDeployment": true
}
```

**Expected Response**:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "workflow": "blog-automation",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-10T21:00:00.000Z",
  "message": "Blog post created successfully"
}
```

Once this endpoint exists:
1. Activate the "Blog Automation Trigger (Webhook)" workflow
2. Call: `https://n8n.theprofitplatform.com.au/webhook/blog-automation-trigger`
3. It will trigger your blog automation and notify Discord

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools Created

### 1. Automated Test Script
**Location**: `test-n8n-webhook.sh`

**Usage**:
```bash
./test-n8n-webhook.sh
```

**Features**:
- Auto-checks if workflow is active
- Tests the webhook
- Shows detailed response
- Provides troubleshooting

### 2. n8n Claude Helper
**Location**: `~/.claude/scripts/n8n-claude.sh`

**Usage**:
```bash
bash ~/.claude/scripts/n8n-claude.sh list          # List workflows
bash ~/.claude/scripts/n8n-claude.sh pull <id>     # Pull workflow
bash ~/.claude/scripts/n8n-claude.sh deploy <file> # Deploy workflow
```

### 3. Slash Commands
- `/n8n-list` - List all workflows
- `/n8n-pull` - Pull workflow from VPS
- `/n8n-deploy` - Deploy workflow
- `/n8n-test` - Test deploy

### 4. Specialized Agent
**Agent**: `n8n-workflow-manager`
- Automatically activates when you mention "n8n"
- Helps manage workflows
- Fixes expression syntax
- Handles deployments
