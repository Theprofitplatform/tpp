## üîß Troubleshooting

### "Invalid login" error

**Gmail:**
- Make sure you're using an App Password, not your regular password
- Enable "Less secure app access" is NOT needed with app passwords
- Check 2-Step Verification is enabled

**Outlook:**
- Use app password if 2FA is enabled
- Regular password works if no 2FA

**Yahoo:**
- Must use app password (regular password doesn't work for SMTP)

### "Connection timeout" error

- Check EMAIL_HOST is correct
- Try port 465 with SSL instead of 587 with TLS
- Check firewall/antivirus isn't blocking

### No email received

- Check spam/junk folder
- Verify EMAIL_TO is correct
- Run `npm run blog:alerts` again
- Check console for error messages
