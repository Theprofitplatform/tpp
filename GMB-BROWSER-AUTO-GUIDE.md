# 🤖 GMB Browser Automation - 100% Free & Automated!

**Cost**: $0 (completely free!)  
**Time**: 0 minutes/week (100% automated)  
**Method**: Browser automation with Playwright

---

## 🎯 How It Works

Since Google deprecated the GMB API, we use **browser automation** instead:

1. Script opens your GMB dashboard
2. Logs in automatically (using saved session)
3. Reads pending posts
4. Fills in the form
5. Clicks "Publish"
6. **All automatic, no manual work!**

---

## 🚀 Setup (One-Time, 5 Minutes)

### Step 1: First-Time Login

Run this once to save your login session:

```bash
cd /mnt/c/Users/abhis/projects/atpp/tpp
node automation/scripts/gmb-auto-post-browser.mjs --setup
```

**What happens:**
1. Browser opens
2. You log into Google
3. Navigate to your GMB posts
4. Press ENTER in terminal
5. Session saved for future use

**Done!** You never need to log in again.

---

### Step 2: Test Auto-Posting

```bash
# Watch it work (browser visible)
node automation/scripts/gmb-auto-post-browser.mjs --post

# Background mode (headless)
node automation/scripts/gmb-auto-post-browser.mjs --post --headless
```

**What it does:**
1. Opens GMB in browser
2. Finds pending posts
3. Posts each one automatically
4. Marks as "posted"
5. Closes browser

**Time**: 2-3 minutes total for 5 posts (runs itself!)

## ⚙️ Automated Workflow Options

### Option A: Run Manually When Convenient

```bash
# Once per week, run this:
node automation/scripts/gmb-auto-post-browser.mjs --post --headless
```

**Time**: 0 active minutes (runs in background)

### Option B: GitHub Actions (Fully Automated!)

Already set up! Just needs your session:

1. Run setup locally (one-time)
2. The workflow will auto-post every week
3. **Completely hands-off!**

**Workflow**: `.github/workflows/auto-post-gmb.yml`

**Schedule**:
- Runs every Sunday @ 7pm Sydney
- 1 hour after posts are generated
- Auto-posts all pending posts

### Option C: Cron Job (If You Have Server)

```bash
# Add to crontab: Post every Sunday at 7pm
0 19 * * 0 cd /path/to/tpp && node automation/scripts/gmb-auto-post-browser.mjs --post --headless
```

## 📊 What Gets Automated

| Task | Before | After | Saved |
|------|--------|-------|-------|
| **Generate content** | Manual | Auto | 20 min |
| **Open GMB** | Manual | Auto | 30 sec |
| **Copy/paste** | Manual | Auto | 3 min |
| **Add CTAs** | Manual | Auto | 1 min |
| **Click publish** | Manual | Auto | 30 sec |
| **TOTAL** | 25 min | 0 min | **25 min** |

**Annual savings**: 21 hours = $1,050-2,100 value

---

## 🔒 Security

**How session storage works:**
- Your login cookies are saved locally
- File: `automation/data/gmb-session.json`
- **NOT committed to Git** (ignored for security)
- Session expires after ~30 days (just run --setup again)

**Safe?** Yes! Same as your browser staying logged in.

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Session Expired

**Error**: "Please log in"

**Fix**:
```bash
node automation/scripts/gmb-auto-post-browser.mjs --setup
```

Re-login and save new session.

### Browser Can't Find Elements

**Error**: "Element not found"

**Fix**: GMB interface might have changed. Update selectors in script or run in non-headless mode to see what's happening:

```bash
node automation/scripts/gmb-auto-post-browser.mjs --post  # Watch it work
```

### Posts Not Marking as Complete

Check the generated folder:
```bash
ls automation/generated/gbp-posts/
cat automation/generated/gbp-posts/gbp-posts-[latest].json
```

---

## 💡 Pro Tips

**For GitHub Actions**:
1. Run --setup locally first
2. Session saved to `automation/data/gmb-session.json`
3. GitHub Actions will use this session
4. Re-setup every 30 days (or when session expires)

**For Reliability**:
- Run in non-headless mode first to verify
- Check GMB after first run
- Set up notifications to alert if it fails

**Monitoring**:
- Check GMB dashboard weekly to verify posts
- GitHub Actions logs show if automation succeeded
- Email notifications on failure (can add)
