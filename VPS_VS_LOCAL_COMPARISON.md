## 🎯 Key Differences

### 1. Execution Environment

**Local (WSL)**
- **OS:** Windows WSL2 (Linux 6.6.87.2-microsoft-standard-WSL2)
- **User:** abhi
- **Path:** `/mnt/c/Users/abhis/projects/atpp/tpp`
- **Node.js:** v20.x (matches local machine)
- **Execution:** Manual or scheduled via Windows Task Scheduler
- **Git:** HTTPS authentication

**VPS**
- **OS:** Ubuntu 24.04.3 LTS (Native Linux)
- **User:** avi
- **Path:** `/home/avi/projects/tpp`
- **Node.js:** v22.19.0 (newer version)
- **Execution:** Automated via cron (M-F 9:00 AM UTC)
- **Git:** SSH authentication

### 2. Automation Approach

**Local**
- ✅ Scripts work perfectly when run manually
- ✅ Full npm script support (`npm run blog:generate` works)
- ❌ No automated scheduling currently
- ❌ Requires manual intervention
- ✅ Good for development and testing

**VPS**
- ✅ Fully automated via cron jobs
- ✅ Runs unattended 24/7
- ⚠️ Had to bypass `npm run blog:generate` (use direct node call)
- ✅ Auto-commits and pushes to GitHub
- ✅ Production-ready

### 3. Script Execution Method

**Local**
```bash
# Works perfectly
npm run blog:generate

# Also works
node automation/scripts/generate-blog-post.js
```

**VPS**
```bash
# DOESN'T WORK (CLI wrapper issue)
npm run blog:generate
# ❌ Exits with code 0 but doesn't create files

# WORKS (direct execution)
node automation/scripts/generate-blog-post.js
# ✅ Creates files successfully
```

**Root Cause:**
- The `blog-cli.mjs` wrapper imports the script as an ES module
- On VPS, the import doesn't execute side effects properly
- Direct node execution works fine on both systems
- Local npm seems to handle this differently than VPS npm

### 4. File Paths & Permissions

**Local (Windows WSL)**
```bash
-rwxrwxrwx  # All files executable (Windows permissions)
/mnt/c/Users/abhis/projects/atpp/tpp/
```

**VPS (Native Linux)**
```bash
-rw-rw-r--  # Standard Linux permissions
/home/avi/projects/tpp/
```

## ⚙️ Configuration Comparison

### Automation Script Differences

**Local Version**
```bash
# Uses npm wrapper
npm run blog:generate >> "$LOG_FILE" 2>&1
```

**VPS Version (Modified)**
```bash
# Uses direct node execution (FIX applied)
node automation/scripts/generate-blog-post.js >> "$LOG_FILE" 2>&1
```

### Cron Jobs

**Local**
- No cron jobs configured
- Manual execution only

**VPS**
```cron
# TPP Blog Automation - Daily blog post generation
# Monday-Friday at 9:00 AM UTC (7:00 PM AEST)
0 9 * * 1-5 cd /home/avi/projects/tpp && ./automation/scripts/vps-auto-blog.sh
```

### Quality Thresholds

**Both Systems (Identical)**
- Minimum quality score: 75/100
- Minimum word count: 1000 (1500+ for max score)
- Required elements: meta description, cover image, internal links, schema
- Auto-retry: 2 attempts on failure

## 🔧 Technical Issues Found & Fixed

### Issue #1: npm run blog:generate Not Creating Files on VPS
**Problem:**
- `npm run blog:generate` exits with code 0 but doesn't create blog post files
- Works perfectly on local WSL but fails silently on VPS

**Root Cause:**
- `blog-cli.mjs` uses dynamic import: `await import(fullPath)`
- `generate-blog-post.js` executes via side effects (no export)
- VPS Node.js v22 handles module imports differently than local Node.js v20
- Import completes but side effects don't execute

**Solution Applied:**
```bash
# Before (BROKEN on VPS)
npm run blog:generate

# After (WORKS on VPS)
node automation/scripts/generate-blog-post.js
```

**Impact:**
- VPS automation now works perfectly
- Local system still works with both methods
- No functional differences in output

### Issue #2: Git Authentication
**Problem:**
- VPS needed SSH key setup for automated git push

**Solution:**
- Generated SSH key on VPS
- Added to GitHub account
- Git configured with automation credentials

---

## 📈 Performance Comparison

**Local (Windows WSL)**
- Initial setup: ~3-5 seconds
- API call (Claude): ~60-90 seconds
- Image fetch (Unsplash): ~2-5 seconds
- File write: Instant

```

**VPS**
```bash
.env.local (Linux file system)
Permissions: -rw------- (600, owner only)
Location: /home/avi/projects/tpp/.env.local
```

**Winner:** VPS has better file permissions

### Git Access
