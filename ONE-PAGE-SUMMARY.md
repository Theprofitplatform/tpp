**Simple > Complex**: 30-sec script beats 20-hour dashboard
**Automate Setup**: One command vs 20 manual steps
**Use Existing Tools**: GitHub + Healthchecks.io (free)
**Measure First**: 1 month of data before building more
**Zero Maintenance**: Set it and forget it

## 🔮 Future (If Needed)

**After 1 month**, if simple solution insufficient:

**Tier 1**: CLI Tool (1-2 days)
**Tier 2**: Web Dashboard (3-5 days)
**Tier 3**: Enterprise (1-2 weeks)

**Plans ready**: See `AUTOMATION-CONTROL-CENTER-PLAN.md`

**Current**: Don't build yet. Simple solution works.
