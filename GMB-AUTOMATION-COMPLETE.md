local details with better search visibility.

## 📈 Performance Tracking

### Metrics to Monitor

**In Google Business Profile Dashboard**:
- Post views (target: 100+ per post)
- Post clicks (target: 5-10% CTR)
- Action clicks (CTA button clicks)
- Engagement (likes, comments, shares)

**Compare**:
- Posts with images vs without
- Different post types (tip vs case study vs offer)
- Posting times (morning vs afternoon)
- Content styles (short vs long, emoji vs no emoji)

### Optimization Tips

**High-Performing Posts**:
- Include a specific number (e.g., "187% increase")
- Ask a question (boosts engagement)
- Use 1-2 relevant emojis
- Include clear CTA
- Post during business hours
- Add eye-catching image

**Low-Performing Posts**:
- Too generic (not Sydney-specific)
- No clear benefit stated
- Too salesy or promotional
- Posted at wrong times
- No image or poor image quality

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### GMB Post Not Generating

**Check**:
```bash
# Verify blog post exists
ls src/content/blog/*affordable-seo*.md

# Check if already synced
cat automation/data/gmb-blog-sync.json

# Manually trigger
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-ant-..."
node automation/scripts/sync-gmb-with-blog.mjs --blog-slug=your-blog-slug
```

### API Key Issues

**Error**: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY not set`

**Fix**:
```bash
# Set in GitHub Secrets (Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions)
# Name: ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
# Value: sk-ant-api03-...

# Or for local testing:
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-ant-..."
```

### No Posts in Generated Folder

**Check workflow run**:
```bash
gh run list --workflow=weekly-gmb-posts.yml

# View logs
gh run view [run-id] --log
```

### Posts Are Too Generic

**Customize** the business info in `gbp-auto-poster.mjs`:

```javascript
businessInfo: {
  name: 'The Profit Platform',
  services: ['SEO', 'Google Ads', 'Web Design'],
  location: 'Sydney, NSW',
  focusAreas: ['Bondi', 'Parramatta', 'North Shore'],  // ADD YOUR AREAS
  uniqueValue: 'No BS, real results, transparent pricing',  // ADD THIS
}
```

## 🚀 Scaling Strategy

### Current: 5 posts/week (2 blog + 3 bulk)

**When to scale**: After month 3, if seeing good engagement

### Scale Option 1: More Blog Posts

Increase blog frequency from 2 to 3-4 posts/week:

```yaml
# In .github/workflows/daily-blog-post.yml
schedule:
  - cron: '0 9 * * 1,2,4,5'  # Mon, Tue, Thu, Fri
```

**Result**: 4 blog posts + 4 GMB posts = 7 total GMB posts/week

### Scale Option 2: More Bulk Posts

Increase bulk generation:

```yaml
# In .github/workflows/weekly-gmb-posts.yml
POSTS_PER_WEEK: 5  # Up from 3
```

**Result**: 2 blog + 5 bulk = 7 total GMB posts/week

### Scale Option 3: Daily Posting

Go aggressive with daily posts:

```yaml
POSTS_PER_WEEK: 7
```

**Result**: Up to 7 bulk + 2 blog = 9 total GMB posts/week

**Warning**: Quality > Quantity. Don't over-post!
