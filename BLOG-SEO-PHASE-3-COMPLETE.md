---

## 🐛 Bugs Identified & Fixed

### Bug #1: External Links Missing (15 points) - FIXED ✅

**Problem:**
- Post-processor added 0 external links
- Only worked for "SEO", "Local", and "Ads" categories
- "Digital Marketing" category not covered

**Root Cause:**
```javascript
// OLD CODE - Only checked 3 categories
if (category.toLowerCase().includes('seo') ||
    category.toLowerCase().includes('local')) {
  // Add links
}
```

**Fix Applied:**
```javascript
// NEW CODE - Added Marketing categories
if (category.toLowerCase().includes('marketing') ||
    category.toLowerCase().includes('digital')) {
  linksToAdd.push({
    text: 'Google Analytics',
    url: EXTERNAL_LINKS['google analytics']
  });
  linksToAdd.push({
    text: 'SEMrush',
    url: EXTERNAL_LINKS['semrush']
  });
  linksToAdd.push({
    text: 'Search Engine Journal',
    url: EXTERNAL_LINKS['searchenginejournal']
  });
}
```

**Impact:** +15 points (66 → 81/110)

---

### Bug #2: FAQ Schema Not Extracted (5 points) - FIXED ✅

**Problem:**
- FAQ section exists in content (7 Q&A pairs)
- Post-processor failed to extract and add to frontmatter
- Regex pattern didn't match properly

**Root Cause:**
```javascript
// OLD REGEX - Too greedy, didn't handle spacing well
const qaPattern = /###+ (.+?)\n\n(.+?)(?=\n###|$)/gs;
```

**Fix Applied:**
```javascript
// NEW REGEX - More precise, handles spacing and cleanup
const faqSection = body.match(/##+ (FAQ|Frequently Asked Questions|Common Questions)([\s\S]+?)(?=##+ [^#]|$)/i);
const qaPattern = /###\s+(.+?)\n\n([\s\S]+?)(?=\n###\s+|$)/g;

// Also cleans up internal links and limits to 250 chars
answer = answer.replace(/Learn more in our guide on \[.*?\]\(.*?\)\.\n*/g, '');
answer = answer.substring(0, 250).replace(/\n+/g, ' ').trim();
```

**Impact:** +5 points (81 → 86/110)

---

### Bug #3: Meta Description Prefix (Enhancement) - FIXED ✅

**Problem:**
- Claude adds "Meta Description: " prefix
- Wastes valuable characters in 160-char limit

**Example:**
```yaml
# BAD
description: "Meta Description: Complete guide to small business..."

# GOOD
description: "Complete guide to small business marketing in Sydney..."
```

**Fix Applied:**
```javascript
// Remove prefix if present
metaDescription = metaDescription.replace(/^meta description:?\s*/i, '');

// Ensure no markdown formatting
metaDescription = metaDescription.replace(/\*\*|\*|__|_/g, '');

// Enforce 160 char limit
if (metaDescription.length > 160) {
  metaDescription = metaDescription.substring(0, 157) + '...';
}
```

**Impact:** Quality improvement (no point change)
