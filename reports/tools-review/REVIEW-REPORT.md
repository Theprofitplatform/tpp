## üìä Performance Analysis

### Load Performance: **Excellent**
```
DOM Content Loaded: 41ms
Load Complete: 0ms (instant)
Total Time: 247ms
```

### Resource Efficiency:
- ‚úÖ CSS animations use GPU acceleration
- ‚úÖ No JavaScript errors
- ‚úÖ Efficient use of transforms (not layout-triggering properties)
- ‚úÖ IntersectionObserver for counter animations (optimal)

### Optimization Opportunities:
1. Consider lazy loading coming-soon tool card images (if any added later)
2. Preconnect to font resources if using external fonts
3. Add `will-change` hints for frequently animated elements

## üêõ Issues & Recommendations

### Critical Issues: **NONE** ‚úÖ
