## ⏱️ Manual Part: 5 Minutes/Week

Since Google deprecated the GMB Posting API, here's the fastest workflow:

### **Every Monday Morning** (2 minutes)

**Post the 2 blog-synced posts from last week:**

1. Open: `automation/generated/gbp-posts/blog-synced/`
2. Look for the 2 latest `.md` files
3. Open each one - content is ready to copy
4. Go to: https://business.google.com/posts
5. Click "Add update"
6. Paste content
7. Add suggested image (Canva if needed)
8. Click "Publish"

**Done!** 2 posts in 2 minutes.

### **Every Sunday Evening** (3 minutes)

**Post the 3 bulk posts for the week:**

1. Check your email for "GMB Posts Generated" notification
2. Open the markdown file link from email
3. Copy the 3 posts for the current week
4. Go to: https://business.google.com/posts
5. Post all 3 (or schedule them for Mon/Wed/Fri)

**Done!** 3 posts in 3 minutes.

3. **Post all 5 at once** on Sunday:
   - 2 blog posts from last week
   - 3 bulk posts for this week
4. **Schedule** them to publish throughout the week

**Time**: 5 minutes, once per week, all posts done!
