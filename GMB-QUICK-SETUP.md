# ðŸš€ Quick GMB Setup - Get Your IDs

## Step 1: Go to Your GMB Dashboard

**Click this link:**
```
https://business.google.com/
```

You should see your business "The Profit Platform"

## Step 2: Get Your Account ID

Once you're on business.google.com, look at the **URL in your browser's address bar**.

It should look like one of these:

**Format A:**
```
https://business.google.com/u/0/n/ACCOUNT_ID/dashboard
```

**Format B:**
```
https://business.google.com/dashboard/accounts/ACCOUNT_ID
```

**Copy the number that appears after `/n/` or `/accounts/`**

Example:
- If URL is: `https://business.google.com/u/0/n/12345678901234567890/dashboard`
- Your Account ID is: `12345678901234567890`

---

## Step 3: Get Your Location ID

On the same page, you should see your business listing. 

**Click on "The Profit Platform"** (your business name)

The URL will change to something like:

**Format A:**
```
https://business.google.com/dashboard/l/LOCATION_ID
```

**Format B:**
```
https://business.google.com/locations/LOCATION_ID
```

**Copy the number after `/l/` or `/locations/`**

Example:
- If URL is: `https://business.google.com/dashboard/l/09876543210987654321`
- Your Location ID is: `09876543210987654321`

## Step 4: Tell Me Both Numbers

Once you have:
1. âœ… Account ID (the first number)
2. âœ… Location ID (the second number)

Just paste them here and I'll configure everything!

## ðŸŽ¯ Alternative: Use Browser Console

1. Go to: https://business.google.com/
2. Press **F12** (opens developer console)
3. Click the **Console** tab
4. Type: `window.location.href`
5. Press Enter
6. Copy the full URL shown

Then paste it here and I'll extract the IDs for you!

## ðŸ“± On Mobile?

If you're on mobile:
1. Go to: https://business.google.com/
2. Once logged in, tap the address bar
3. Select all text in the URL
