# Local Citation Tracking & NAP Consistency Spreadsheet
**Business:** The Profit Platform
**Last Updated:** October 5, 2025
**Goal:** 100% NAP consistency across all citations

---

## üéØ What Are Citations & Why Track Them?

### Definition
A **citation** is any online mention of your business's NAP:
- **N**ame: The Profit Platform
- **A**ddress: [Your address or "Service Area: Greater Sydney"]
- **P**hone: +61 487 286 451

### Why NAP Consistency Matters
- **Local Rankings:** Google validates business legitimacy via consistent NAP
- **Trust Signals:** Inconsistent NAP = Google distrusts your business
- **Map Pack:** Inconsistent citations can exclude you from map pack
- **Penalty Risk:** Major inconsistencies can trigger manual review/demotion

### Impact on Rankings
- ‚úÖ Consistent NAP = +15-30% local ranking boost
- ‚ùå Inconsistent NAP = -20-40% ranking penalty
- ‚ùå Different phone numbers = Google ignores citations entirely

## üö® Red Flags to Avoid

### Citation Spam (Will Hurt Rankings)
- ‚ùå Submitting to 100+ low-quality directories in one day
- ‚ùå Using different NAP formats on different sites

- ‚ùå Using tracking phone numbers (Google knows)
- ‚ùå Listing fake addresses (will get suspended)

### Duplicate Listings (Major Issue)

### Citation Hijacking (Competitor Sabotage)
- **Problem:** Competitors edit your citations with wrong NAP
- **Solution:** Claim all listings, monitor monthly for unauthorized edits
- **How to monitor:** Set Google Alert for `"The Profit Platform" "Sydney"`
