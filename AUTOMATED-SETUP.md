## üÜò Troubleshooting

### "Setup script not found"

```bash
# Make sure scripts are executable
chmod +x scripts/*.sh

# Then run again
npm run health:quick-setup
```

### "jq: command not found"

```bash
# Install jq
sudo apt-get install jq

# Then run setup again
```

### "GitHub CLI not found"

GitHub CLI is optional. Setup will work without it, you'll just need to add secrets manually.

To install (optional):
```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
curl -fsSL https://cli.github.com/packages/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg | sudo dd of=/usr/share/keyrings/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg
echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg] https://cli.github.com/packages stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/github-cli.list
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install gh
```

### "Healthchecks.io ping failed"

Check your ping URL format:
- ‚úÖ Correct: `https://hc-ping.com/xxxxx-xxx-xxx-xxx-xxxxx`
- ‚ùå Wrong: `https://healthchecks.io/checks/...`

You want the PING URL, not the dashboard URL.
