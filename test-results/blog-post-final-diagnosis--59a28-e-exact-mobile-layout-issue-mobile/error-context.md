          - heading "Why 90% of Sydney Remarketing Campaigns Fail (And How Yours Can Actually Work)" [level=2] [ref=e74]
          - paragraph [ref=e75]: "Here’s what happens to most Sydney online stores: A customer visits your Bondi Junction store’s website. They look at your products. They leave without buying. You set up a remarketing campaign. You expect to win them back. After spending $2,000 over three months, you get maybe two sales."
          - paragraph [ref=e78]: Sound familiar? You’re not alone. Most businesses can’t make money from remarketing campaigns. Why? They treat them like regular display ads.
          - paragraph [ref=e79]: The problem isn’t remarketing itself. It’s that Sydney businesses use old methods. These methods ignore how people actually shop online today. When someone leaves your Parramatta warehouse’s product page, they’re not ready for the same “20% off” banner they see everywhere.
          - paragraph [ref=e82]: In this guide, you’ll learn the TPP Remarketing Conversion Framework. This is a step-by-step approach we made for Sydney online stores. It turns window shoppers into paying customers. We’ll cover everything from audience groups to creative strategies that work in Sydney’s tough market.
          - heading "Understanding Remarketing Campaigns in Today’s Sydney Market" [level=2] [ref=e83]
          - paragraph [ref=e84]: "Remarketing campaigns target people who already visited your website. This gives you a second chance to convert them. A third chance. A fourth chance. But here’s where most Sydney businesses mess up: they send the same message to everyone who visited their site."
          - paragraph [ref=e85]: A person who spent five minutes on your product pages in Chatswood has different reasons for buying. Compare this to someone who left after ten seconds from Manly. Yet most remarketing campaigns treat them the same. This explains why the average remarketing conversion rate across Australian online stores sits at just 2.3%.
          - heading "The Sydney Online Store Challenge" [level=3] [ref=e86]
          - paragraph [ref=e87]: Sydney’s online store world is very competitive. Major retailers own search results. International players use aggressive pricing. Local businesses need remarketing strategies that do more than just remind people you exist.
          - paragraph [ref=e88]: The old “spray and pray” approach shows the same ad to everyone who visited your site. This wastes budget on people who were never serious buyers. It also under-spends on high-intent prospects who just needed the right push.
          - heading "The Real Problem with Most Remarketing Campaigns" [level=2] [ref=e89]

            - text: "accounts, we found three big mistakes that kill campaign performance:"
          - paragraph [ref=e92]:
            - strong [ref=e93]: First, poor audience groups.
            - text: Most businesses create one or two broad audiences. Like “website visitors” and “cart abandoners.” This ignores the huge difference between someone who viewed your homepage and someone who compared three products for twenty minutes.
          - paragraph [ref=e94]:
            - strong [ref=e95]: Second, creative mismatch.
            - text: Showing product-focused ads to someone who spent time on your About page doesn’t work. Neither does showing discount offers to someone already price-shopping. This shows you don’t understand where they are in the buying journey.
          - paragraph [ref=e96]:
            - strong [ref=e97]: Third, timing failures.
            - text: Hitting someone with aggressive sales messages right after they leave kills conversion potential. So does waiting too long and letting competitors capture their attention.
          - heading "Why Old Approaches Don’t Work in Sydney" [level=3] [ref=e98]
          - paragraph [ref=e99]: 53% of Australian online shoppers prefer a more personalised shopping experience from retailers, indicating that generic marketing like “Come back and save 10%” banners may feel impersonal or spammy to well-researched consumers. Additionally, 19.5% of Australian customers consulted price comparison websites before making a purchase, showing that Sydney consumers actively research and compare options. [1]
          - paragraph [ref=e100]: The solution isn’t more aggressive remarketing. It’s smarter remarketing that matches message to mindset.
          - heading "The TPP Remarketing Conversion Framework" [level=2] [ref=e101]
          - paragraph [ref=e102]: Our framework divides remarketing campaigns into five phases. Each targets specific user behaviors and intent levels. Instead of one broad campaign, you create multiple focused campaigns. These speak directly to where someone is in their buying journey.

          - heading "Geographic Micro-Targeting" [level=3] [ref=e147]

          - paragraph [ref=e188]: Most businesses set up dynamic ads and wonder why they underperform. The secret is customizing your product feed and creative templates for different audience segments.
