   - Include local landmarks or business districts when relevant

4. E-E-A-T SIGNALS (Demonstrate GENUINE expertise - CRITICAL FOR GOOGLE):

   **ABSOLUTELY BANNED - DO NOT USE:**
   - Fabricated statistics - ESPECIALLY these patterns:
     * "X% of Sydney businesses/companies/stores..."
     * "90% of [anything] fail/struggle/make mistakes..."
     * Specific percentages without citations (e.g., "76% of...")
     * Revenue claims without evidence (e.g., "$500K+ revenue")
   - Made-up case studies (e.g., "A Bondi Junction café we worked with...")
   - Invented before/after numbers without real data
   - Fake client testimonials or quotes
   - Unverifiable claims about "our clients" without context

   **CRITICAL: If you use a percentage or statistic, you MUST cite a source immediately after in [Source: Name] format**

   **REQUIRED - Use ONLY these approaches:**
   - Share general observations: "We've noticed Sydney businesses often struggle with..."
   - Use industry data with citations: "According to [Source], X% of businesses..."
   - Describe typical scenarios: "A common challenge we see is..."
   - Reference your team's expertise: "Based on our experience in SEO/Google Ads..."
   - Be specific about YOUR methodology: "Our approach involves..."
   - Admit limitations: "This works well for X, but may not suit Y..."

   **Unique TPP Framework Required:**
   - Create ONE original framework/methodology for this topic
   - Name it: "The TPP [Topic] Framework" or "[X]-Step [Topic] Method"
   - Make it visually describable (readers should be able to picture it)
   - Example: "TPP Local SEO Pyramid", "5-Phase Content Strategy", "SCALE Framework"

5. SEO OPTIMIZATION (STRICTLY ENFORCED):
   - **CRITICAL**: Include exact target keyword "{target_keyword}" in:
     * First H2 heading (MANDATORY - include the full keyword phrase)
     * First 100 words of content (MANDATORY - use it naturally in intro)
     * At least 2 additional H2 headings (naturally)
     * Throughout content (naturally, 1.5-2% density)
   - Use LSI keywords and semantic variations (20+ related terms)
   - Add 5-8 internal links to:
     * [SEO](/seo) or [local SEO](/seo)
     * [Google Ads](/google-ads)
     * [web design](/web-design) or [website design](/web-design)
     * [digital marketing](/services) or [marketing services](/services)
     * [contact us](/contact) for CTAs
     * [tools](/tools/keyword-research) or other relevant tools
     * Related blog posts when naturally relevant
   - Include 3-5 specific Sydney postcodes (e.g., 2000, 2088, 2026, 2060)

6. CONTENT QUALITY & DATA INTEGRITY:

   **Statistics & Data Requirements:**
   - ONLY use statistics from verified sources (Google, industry reports, government data)
   - ALWAYS cite sources: "According to [Source Name], X% of..." [Source: Domain]
   - If no data exists, describe observations: "Many Sydney businesses struggle with..."
   - Use Perplexity-enriched statistics where available (system will add these)
   - Never invent percentages, revenue figures, or case study results

   **Content Structure:**
   - Provide actionable, step-by-step frameworks
   - Include specific examples for every major point (without fabrication)
   - Use bullet points and numbered lists for scannability
   - Short paragraphs (2-3 sentences maximum)
   - Include rhetorical questions to maintain engagement
   - Add blockquotes for key insights from authoritative sources

7. UNIQUE VALUE (Differentiate from generic AI content):

   **Required Elements:**
   - ONE unique TPP framework/methodology (named and original)
   - Contrarian or non-obvious advice (question common assumptions)
   - Specific Sydney market observations (not generic "Sydney" mentions)
   - 2025 trends with authoritative sources
   - Common mistakes observed in the industry
   - Tactical how-to advice (not theoretical concepts)

   **Make it Unmistakably Human:**
   - Use conversational phrases: "Here's the thing...", "Look...", "To be honest..."
   - Admit when something is difficult or uncertain
   - Share real challenges (without specific client details)
   - Use Sydney-specific examples that AI wouldn't know

8. EXTERNAL AUTHORITY (MANDATORY):
   - Include 2-3 external links to high-authority sources
   - Acceptable domains: support.google.com, developers.google.com, searchengineland.com, moz.com, semrush.com, ahrefs.com, hubspot.com, neilpatel.com, backlinko.com
   - Government/academic sources: .gov.au, .edu.au, abs.gov.au (Australian Bureau of Statistics)
   - Link format: [Link text](https://authoritative-source.com/article) with [Source: Domain Name]
   - Examples:
     * "According to [Google's official documentation](https://support.google.com/google-ads), Quality Score is..." [Source: Google Support]
     * "A [study by Search Engine Land](https://searchengineland.com/study) found that..." [Source: Search Engine Land]
   - Links must be relevant to the topic and add genuine value
   - Do NOT link to competitors or low-quality sites

9. TONE & STYLE:
   - Conversational but professional
   - Use "you" to address reader directly
   - Use "we" for agency perspective
   - Active voice preferred
   - Confident but not arrogant
   - Educational not promotional
   - Honest about what works and what doesn't

10. STRICTLY AVOID (Will fail quality check):

    **AI Clichés & Red Flags - NEVER USE THESE:**
    - "Here's what'll shock you", "This will surprise you", "Shocking truth"
    - "Game-changer", "Revolutionary", "Secret weapon"
    - "Hidden tricks", "Insider secrets", "The secret is", "Secret to"
    - "Hack", "Life hack", "Growth hack"
    - "Mind-blowing", "Crushing it", "Next level"
    - "Holy grail", "Silver bullet", "Magic formula"
    - "X% of [Sydney/businesses] fail/struggle/make mistakes"
    - Fabricated statistics without sources
    - Made-up case studies or client stories
    - Invented revenue numbers or ROI claims

    **If you accidentally use these words, the content will be rejected**

    **Generic Content Issues:**
    - Generic advice available everywhere
    - Keyword stuffing or unnatural phrasing
    - Overly salesy language
    - Corporate jargon and buzzwords
    - Vague statements without specifics
    - Template-style content that looks automated
    - Lists without context or explanation

- Use Australian English spelling throughout
- CRITICAL: Include 2-3 external authority links in markdown format: [text](URL)
- Include [Source: ...] citations for any statistics or data
- Mark places where internal links should go like this: [SEO](/seo) or [Google Ads](/google-ads)

- Provide unique value in every section
- Focus on practical, actionable advice
- DO NOT include the post title as an H1 in the content
