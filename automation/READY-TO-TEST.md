# ✅ Image Relevance Solution - Ready to Test

**Status:** Solution implemented and ready to deploy
**Time to complete:** 5 minutes (2 min setup + 3 min processing)

---

## What Was Fixed

### Your Feedback:
> "the images are still not relevant create a plan to fix it"

### Problems Identified:
1. Overly specific search terms ("plumber working on pipes") don't exist on Unsplash
2. API returns random images when searches fail
3. Unsplash rate limited at 50 requests/hour (hit multiple times)

### Solution Implemented:
1. ✅ **Improved Keywords** - Changed to broader professional terms that actually exist:
   - "plumber" → "professional tradesman tools"
   - "lawyer" → "professional office desk"
   - "conversion" → "business growth chart"
   - 60+ industry mappings updated

2. ✅ **Added Pexels Fallback** - Automatic dual-source system:
   - Tries Unsplash first (50 req/hour)
   - Falls back to Pexels if rate limited (200 req/hour)
   - Combined: 250 requests/hour vs previous 50
