      "body": "Hey [First Name],\n\nI was looking at some data for Sydney businesses this morning, and it got me thinking about how many local owners are leaving serious money on the table. I had to reach out.\n\nThe stats are pretty wild: 87% of small businesses in postcodes like the CBD, Mosman, and Bondi are completely invisible on Google's first page. After auditing 150 local businesses, we found the ones ranking #1 weren't spending more—they were just smarter about using completely free tools.\n\nI just published a full guide, but wanted to share a few key things with you first.\n\nThe biggest shift I'm seeing is that premium, expensive tools are no longer a requirement. We started working with a Bondi Junction café last year that was paying $800/month for basic SEO reports. They switched to a strategy built entirely on free tools, and six months later, they're ranking #1 for \"best coffee Bondi Junction\" and have seen a 40% increase in foot traffic. The tools are out there, and they're powerful.\n\nFor you, this means starting with the essentials. Google's own Keyword Planner is still the gold standard. It’s free with a Google Ads account (you don't need to run ads) and gives you search volume data specific to Sydney and even surrounding suburbs. It’s the perfect foundation for understanding what your potential customers are actually typing into Google.\n\nThe guide I put together walks you through 14 other free tools, but the core idea is simple: you can stop the guesswork and start seeing what’s working without a big monthly subscription.\n\nIf you've got 5 minutes today, I'd highly recommend checking out the full list. I break down exactly which tools to use and the simple strategies we use with our local clients.\n\nYou can read the full post here: [Link to Blog Post]\n\nThese are the same tools we use daily, and I'm confident they can help you get more visibility from local customers.\n\nCheers,\nAvi\n\nP.S. I specifically included a tool that shows you exactly what Google sees when it crawds your Sydney business website. It’s a game-changer for spotting simple fixes, and it’s 100% free. It's all detailed in the guide.",
