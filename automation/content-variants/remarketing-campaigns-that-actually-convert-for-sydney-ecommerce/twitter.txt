Shocking stat: 87% of Sydney online stores NEVER follow up with visitors who didn't buy

That's like watching customers walk out of your physical store without saying a word 😱

Here's the reality: 96% of first-time visitors leave without purchasing

But the magic happens when they return - that's where remarketing works its wonders ✨

Sydney stores using proper remarketing see 15-25% conversion rates

Compared to the average 3% for cold traffic

That's 5-8x more revenue from the same visitors 💰

Simple starting strategy: Show ads to people who:

• Viewed products but didn't buy
• Added to cart but abandoned
• Visited specific category pages

Pro tip: Create different ad messages for each audience

Cart abandoners get urgency messages
Product viewers get social proof
Category browsers get educational content

Remarketing isn't creepy - it's helpful

You're reminding people about products they already showed interest in

It's like being a helpful sales assistant, not a stalker 🛍️
