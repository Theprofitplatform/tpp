SUBJECT: The $47K Google Ads mistake I see daily

---

Hey [First Name],

I just finished reviewing another Google Ads account that made my stomach turn. A law firm in Bondi Junction was burning $3,900 every month with almost nothing to show for it. The worst part? It's the same mistake I see Sydney businesses make every single day.

Here's what happened...

**The "Set and Forget" Trap**

This law firm set up automated bidding and walked away. Google's algorithms were running wild, bidding on everything from "free legal advice" to "DIY divorce forms" - keywords that would never convert for a premium legal practice.

Sound familiar? 

Most Sydney business owners think Google's AI knows their business better than they do. Big mistake. Google's job is to spend your budget, not maximize your profits.

**The Three Bidding Strategies That Actually Work**

After auditing 200+ Sydney accounts this year, here's what I've learned:

1) **Manual CPC for New Accounts**
If you're spending under $2,000/month or just starting out, manual bidding gives you control. Yes, it takes more work, but you'll learn which keywords actually drive customers through your door.

2) **Target CPA for Lead Generation**
Once you have 30+ conversions per month, this is gold for service businesses. I set this up for a Surry Hills accountant last month - their cost per lead dropped from $180 to $67 while leads doubled.

3) **Target ROAS for E-commerce**
If you're selling products online, this strategy focuses on revenue, not just clicks. A Paddington fashion retailer went from 2.1x to 4.8x return on ad spend using this approach.

**The Sydney-Specific Challenge**

Here's something most guides won't tell you: Sydney's competitive market means you can't just copy strategies from overseas. When you're competing with businesses in Circular Quay, Bondi, and Parramatta simultaneously, your bidding needs to account for location-based competition.

I've seen CBD businesses overpay by 300% because they're bidding against each other for the same customers who might drive to Chatswood for a better deal.

**The Quick Win**

Before you change anything, check your Search Terms report. I guarantee you're wasting money on irrelevant searches. That Bondi Junction law firm was paying $23 per click for "legal aid free consultation" - people who would never pay their $500/hour rates.

One hour of cleaning up search terms typically saves my clients $800-1,500 per month.

**Your Next Step**

Look, I could write another 2,000 words about bid adjustments, dayparting, and audience targeting, but you probably want to know which strategy fits YOUR specific situation.

I've put together the complete breakdown of all six major bidding strategies, including the exact scenarios where each one works best for Sydney businesses.

It includes the real numbers from that Bondi Junction case study, plus three other Sydney businesses that transformed their results by switching bidding strategies.
