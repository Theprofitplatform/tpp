      "body": "Hey [First Name],\n\nI was reviewing some local data this morning that stopped me mid-coffee, and I knew I had to share it with you.\n\nHere's what jumped out at me: 78% of Sydney B2B companies - from Parramatta to the CBD to North Sydney - are generating fewer than 5 leads per month through their websites.\n\nThat's not just a missed opportunity - it's leaving an estimated $2.3 million in potential revenue on the table for many businesses.\n\nAfter working with dozens of Sydney companies, I've noticed three key patterns that separate the businesses crushing their content marketing from those struggling to get traction:\n\nFirst, the most successful companies treat content like a conversation, not a broadcast. They're creating content that directly answers their ideal clients' biggest questions and pain points. Think about what keeps your clients up at night - that's your content goldmine.\n\nSecond, they're mapping their content to where their customers are in the buying journey. It's not just about creating great content, but creating the right content at the right time. Problem-solving guides for people early in their research, comparison content for those weighing options, and educational insights to build authority.\n\nThird, they're thinking local but acting global. While they're based in Sydney and understand our unique business landscape, they're not limiting their reach to just our postcodes. The best content attracts clients from across Australia and beyond who value Sydney's business expertise.\n\nThe good news? This isn't about working harder - it's about working smarter with a clear framework that aligns your content with your business goals.\n\nI've put together a detailed guide showing exactly how to implement this approach, including the specific content mix that's working right now for Sydney B2B companies.\n\nWant to see the complete framework?\nRead the full post here: [Link to blog post]\n\nCheers,\nTPP Team\n\nP.S. I included a breakdown of how much content you actually need to produce each month - it's probably less than you think, which means you can start seeing results without overwhelming your team.",
