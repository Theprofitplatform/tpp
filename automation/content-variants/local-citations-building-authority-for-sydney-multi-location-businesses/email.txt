SUBJECT: 67% of Sydney businesses sabotage their rankings

---

Hey [First Name],

I just finished auditing a fitness chain here in Sydney, and what I found made my stomach drop. Despite spending $4,500 monthly on marketing, only 2 of their 8 locations ranked in the top 3 for local searches.

The problem wasn't their Google Business Profile or content strategy. It was something most Sydney business owners completely overlook: local citations.

**Here's what's probably happening to your business right now:**

Your business information is scattered across hundreds of online directories - Yellow Pages, TrueLocal, Yelp, industry sites. But here's the kicker: it's probably listed differently on each one.

Maybe it's "Smith Plumbing" on one site and "Smith Plumbing Services" on another. Or your Bondi location shows "Suite 5" on TrueLocal but "Unit 5" on StartLocal.

Google sees these inconsistencies and thinks: "Are these the same business? Are they legitimate?" So instead of boosting your rankings, these citations actually hurt you.

**The citation audit that changed everything:**

That fitness chain I mentioned? Their business appeared in 147 different variations across directories. Same locations, but Google couldn't connect the dots.

We spent 6 weeks cleaning up their citations - standardizing every business name, address, and phone number across 50+ directories. The result? Within 90 days, 6 of their 8 locations jumped into the top 3 for their main keywords.

**Your Sydney citation action plan:**

First, audit your current citations. Search for your business on major directories and note every variation you find.

Then, prioritize the big players: Google Business Profile, Yellow Pages, TrueLocal, Yelp, and your industry-specific directories. These carry the most weight for Sydney searches.

Finally, create a master NAP document. Every single mention of your business online should match this exactly - down to the punctuation.

**Why this matters more in Sydney:**

Our market is incredibly competitive. When someone searches "plumber Bondi" or "accountant CBD," Google has hundreds of options to choose from.

Consistent citations are like votes of confidence. They tell Google: "This business is legitimate, established, and trustworthy." Without them, you're fighting an uphill battle against competitors who've got their citation game locked down.

I've put together a complete framework covering exactly how we build citation authority for multi-location Sydney businesses. It includes the specific directories that matter most, how to handle variations across suburbs, and the citation cleanup process that gets results in 60-90 days.

This is the foundation that makes everything else work. Get your citations right, and your other marketing efforts will be 10x more effective.

Cheers,

P.S. If you've got multiple locations, don't try to tackle this all at once. Start with your highest-revenue location, get those citations perfect, then systematically work through the others. I've seen too many businesses burn out trying to fix everything simultaneously and end up with an even bigger mess.
