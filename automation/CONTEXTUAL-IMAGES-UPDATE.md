# Contextual Hero Images - Improved System

**Date:** 2025-01-21
**Status:** ‚úÖ Implemented (Rate Limited - Partial Completion)

## Problem Identified

The previous image system was using **random generic keywords** instead of **contextually relevant** search terms:
- "SEO for Plumbers" post ‚Üí Got generic "business" or "laptop" image
- "Conversion Optimization" post ‚Üí Got generic "marketing" image
- No connection between blog topic and hero image

**User Feedback:** "The photos are not matching the context of the page. I want it to showcase something that relates to the topic of the blog"

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Intelligent Keyword Extraction System

**New Three-Tier Approach:**

#### **Tier 1: Industry/Profession-Specific Keywords** (Highest Priority)
System now detects 60+ specific topics in blog titles:

**Professions:**
- `plumber` ‚Üí "plumber working on pipes"
- `lawyer` ‚Üí "lawyer in office"
- `dentist` ‚Üí "dental clinic"
- `electrician` ‚Üí "electrician working"
- `accountant` ‚Üí "accountant with calculator"
- And 40+ more...

**Services:**
- `ecommerce` ‚Üí "online shopping website"
- `restaurant` ‚Üí "restaurant dining"
- `automotive` ‚Üí "car mechanic"
- `landscaping` ‚Üí "garden landscaping"
- And 15+ more...

**Marketing Concepts:**
- `conversion` ‚Üí "sales conversion funnel"
- `analytics` ‚Üí "data analytics dashboard"
- `strategy` ‚Üí "business strategy planning"
- `funnel` ‚Üí "sales funnel diagram"
- And 15+ more...

#### **Tier 2: Title Keywords Extraction**
If no specific industry found, extracts meaningful words from title:
- Excludes common words: "guide", "complete", "sydney", "2025", "how", "why", etc.
- Combines top 3 meaningful words
- Example: "Mobile-First Web Design" ‚Üí "mobile first design"

#### **Tier 3: Category Fallbacks**
Only used if Tiers 1 & 2 fail:
- SEO ‚Üí "search engine results analytics"
- Google Ads ‚Üí "digital advertising dashboard"
- Web Design ‚Üí "web design laptop"
- Etc.

### 2. Examples of Improved Matching

**Before vs After:**

| Blog Post Title | Old Keyword (Random) | New Keyword (Contextual) |
|----------------|----------------------|---------------------------|
| "SEO for Plumbers Sydney" | "business" | "plumber working on pipes" ‚úÖ |
| "SEO for Lawyers Sydney" | "technology" | "lawyer in office" ‚úÖ |
| "Conversion Rate Optimization" | "marketing campaign" | "sales conversion funnel" ‚úÖ |
| "eCommerce Remarketing" | "digital marketing" | "online shopping website" ‚úÖ |
| "B2B Content Marketing" | "workspace" | "business meeting" ‚úÖ |

## Rate Limiting Situation

### What Happened
Hit Unsplash API rate limit after 8 posts:
- **Demo API Keys:** 50 requests/hour
- **Script Made:** ~24 requests (8 posts √ó 3 retry attempts)
- **Result:** 403 Forbidden errors for remaining posts

### Unsplash Rate Limits

**Demo/Development Keys:**
- 50 requests per hour
- Best for testing and low-volume use

**Production Keys** (Apply at unsplash.com/api):
- Up to 50,000 requests per month
- 5,000 requests per hour
- Recommended for production use

### Next Steps to Complete

**Option 1: Wait and Resume (1 hour)**
```bash
# Wait 60 minutes for rate limit to reset, then:
npm run image:refresh-all
```

**Option 2: Batch Processing (Recommended for Large Updates)**
The script already includes 2-second delays between requests. For production keys, you can process all 34 posts in ~2 minutes.

**Option 3: Manual Selective Updates**
Update specific posts one at a time:
```javascript
// Edit and run individual updates
node automation/scripts/unsplash-fetcher.mjs "SEO" "Your Post Title"
```

## Current Status

‚úÖ **System Upgraded:**
- 60+ industry-specific keyword mappings
- Smart title keyword extraction
- 3-tier fallback system

‚úÖ **8 Posts Updated:**
- All showing contextually relevant images
- Professional photographers credited
- Duplicate tracking working

‚è≥ **26 Posts Remaining:**
- Will be updated when rate limit resets
- System ready to process them
- All improvements already in place

## Testing the New System

You can test the keyword detection:

```bash
# Check what keywords would be used for different titles
node -e "
const title = 'SEO for Plumbers Sydney';
console.log(title.toLowerCase().includes('plumber') ? 'plumber working on pipes' : 'fallback');
"
```

**Examples:**
- "SEO for Dentists" ‚Üí Detects "dentist" ‚Üí "dental clinic"
- "Restaurant Marketing" ‚Üí Detects "restaurant" ‚Üí "restaurant dining"
- "Real Estate SEO" ‚Üí Detects "real estate" ‚Üí "real estate agent showing house"
- "Gym Marketing" ‚Üí Detects "gym" ‚Üí "fitness gym"

## Usage Commands

# Check current images
npm run image:check-duplicates

# Refresh ALL images with contextual relevance
npm run image:refresh-all

# Update only posts without images
npm run image:update-all

```
