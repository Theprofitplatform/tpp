## 🆘 Need Help?

**Common Issues:**

**"Backend API URL not configured"**
→ Run: `npx wrangler pages project env list` to check if variable is set

**"Analysis Failed"**
→ First request takes 10-20s (cold start), wait and retry

**Can't deploy to Railway**
→ Use Render.com instead (also FREE and easier)

**Results look weird**
→ Expected with mock SERP data. Add SerpApi key for real data ($10-20/mo)

---

## 🚀 Ready to Launch?

**Fastest path (5 minutes):**

1. Run `./deploy-backend.sh` (or `.ps1` on Windows)
2. Select option `1` (Render.com)
3. Follow the prompts

5. Test at https://theprofitplatform.com.au/tools/keyword-gap

**You're 5 minutes from launch!** 🎉
