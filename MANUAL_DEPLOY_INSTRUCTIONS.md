# 🚀 Manual Cloudflare Pages Deployment

## ⚠️ API Issue Detected

Cloudflare's API is currently experiencing issues (503 Service Unavailable). Here are alternative deployment methods:

## ✅ Deployment Ready

- **Account ID**: 8fc18f5691f32fccc13eb17e85a0ae10
- **Existing Project**: `tpp` (tpp.pages.dev)
- **Build**: ✅ Production-ready (3.5MB)
- **Parity**: ✅ Verified exact match

## 📱 Method 1: Dashboard Upload (Recommended)

1. **Go to Cloudflare Pages Dashboard:**
   - URL: https://dash.cloudflare.com/8fc18f5691f32fccc13eb17e85a0ae10/pages
   - Or: https://dash.cloudflare.com/pages

2. **Access existing project:**
   - Click on the "tpp" project
   - Click "Create a new deployment"

3. **Upload build:**
   - Select "Upload assets"
   - Upload the entire `dist/` folder contents
   - Or upload `tpp-cloudflare-deployment.tar.gz` and extract

## 🔄 Method 2: Try CLI Later

When Cloudflare's API is working:

```bash
export CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN="ScYo0g7TUQg79oHQ7bztswx-ew9tJTckWuPEXeT5"
npx wrangler pages deploy dist --project-name=tpp
```

## 📦 What to Upload

Upload all contents from the `dist/` folder:

```
Files to upload:

## 🌐 Domain Configuration

After deployment:
1. The site will be available at: `tpp.pages.dev`
2. Add custom domain: `theprofitplatform.com.au`
3. Configure DNS to point to Cloudflare

## ✅ Verification Commands

Before uploading, you can verify everything is ready:

```bash
# Check build status
ls -la dist/
du -sh dist/

# Run final parity check
npm run parity:scan

# Expected output:
# ✅ PARITY PASS
# ✅ CSS order: PASS (17 stylesheets)
# ✅ JS order: PASS (7 scripts)
# ✅ SEO head parity: PASS
```

## 🎯 Current Status

- ✅ Migration completed with pixel-perfect parity
- ✅ Build ready for deployment (3.5MB)
- ✅ Cloudflare Worker configured
- ✅ All assets included (22 files, 494.1KB)
- ✅ Authentication working (API token valid)
- ⚠️ Cloudflare API temporarily unavailable

## 🔧 Alternative: Git Integration

If you prefer continuous deployment:

1. Push to your Git repository:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Deploy TPP Astro to Cloudflare Pages"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. Connect the repository in Cloudflare Pages dashboard:
   - Framework: Astro
   - Build command: `npm run build`
   - Output directory: `dist`
   - Node.js version: 18.x
